# 4.1.2 Install OpenCRVS locally

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=OpenCRVS&feature=youtu.be&v=q-bO42USMUw" %}

The following instructions will guide you on how to set up a local, demo development environment of OpenCRVS using our fictional country configuration: "Farajaland".

1. Check you have installed all the dependencies in the previous section
2. Clone OpenCRVS Core:

```
git clone git@github.com:opencrvs/opencrvs-core.git
```

3. Navigate inside the core directory

```
cd opencrvs-core
```

4. Ensure that you are on the master branch. The master branch is always aligned to the latest release.  Alternatively, checkout a release branch.

```
git checkout master // or git checkout release-v1.9.0
```

5. Run the optional installer command explained below, or alternatively proceed to step 6. &#x20;

This installer script is quite opinionated regarding your setup and may fail depending on your permissions.  Depending on your laptop, you may prefer a manual setup process.

This installer script will use [tmux](3.1.1-install-the-required-dependencies.md) to:

* Test that your dependencies are installed correctly
* Checks that required ports are available. **Note:** MacOS runs AirPlay on port 5000. Mac users need to disable AirPlay in System Preferences in order to run OpenCRVS.
* Download and install all Docker images
* Check out the example OpenCRVS country configuration repository in a directory alongside opencrvs-core: [https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig)
* [Start](3.1.3-starting-and-stopping-opencrvs.md) OpenCRVS Core
* [Start](3.1.3-starting-and-stopping-opencrvs.md) the OpenCRVS country configuration repository with test data from our fictional country, "Farajaland" and [seed](../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.8-seeding-your-local-database.md) local databases with Farajaland reference data

If there are any missing dependencies the script will exit and display instructions. Once the dependency is satisfied, you can try again.

On completion you will see the OpenCRVS logo

* Open the url [**`http://localhost:3020/`**](http://localhost:3020/)
* You have successfully installed OpenCRVS! 🎉
* Proceed to login using the details in the [section 3.14 Log in to OpenCRVS](3.1.4-log-in-to-opencrvs-locally.md).
* To stop OpenCRVS running in the installer, type **ctrl+c**, then **exit** in each tmux terminal window

To run the installer script, use this command:

```
bash setup.sh
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not use **`sudo bash setup.sh`**!

The `bash setup.sh` command needs to set folder permissions for Elasticsearch and Docker. If you use sudo, the owner of the /data folder becomes root. You will encounter permissions problems that are hard to debug.
{% endhint %}

If the installation was successful, proceed to the [next section](3.1.3-starting-and-stopping-opencrvs.md) for further learning about safely starting and stopping OpenCRVS.  Otherwise, if you encountered issues, continue with the manual apprach below:

#### Manual installation locally

If you are not using the script above, or encounter issues with it, proceeding manually is the best bet to incrementally solve local issues on your laptop.

1. Navigate outside of opencrvs-core and clone OpenCRVS Countryconfig in a directory alongside your clone of opencrvs-core so that you have in a parent directory, both opencrvs-core and opencrvs-countryconfig:

```
cd ../
git clone git@github.com:opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig.git
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-06 at 10.20.19.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Inside countryconfig ensure that you are also on the master or an equivalent release branch.&#x20;

```
cd opencrvs-countryconfig
git checkout master // or git checkout release-v1.9.0
```

3. Now prepare some terminal windows like so.  In this example, 4 windows are open when running OpenCRVS.  Type `nvm use` in each window to ensure you are running the correct node version.

Notice that 3 windows are navigated inside the opencrvs-core directory, and one (bottom-left) is in the opencrvs-countryconfig directory.  _(The tool_ [_oh-my-zsh_](https://ohmyz.sh/) _helps display the correct git branch)_

4. Ensure Docker Desktop is running, and in the **opencrvs-core** window in the **top right**, run the following command to download and run Docker images containing the database dependencies. &#x20;

This will fail if Docker installation has failed.&#x20;

```
yarn compose:deps
```

Once all the dependencies are downloaded and started, if you run `docker ps` in another window you can check that all have started up successfully.   You will have to debug dependency and port problems yourself if any container is not starting.  Refer to any error messages you see, unique to your laptop and internet resources to help you.  With the exception of **opencrvs/hearth**, these dependencies are outside the scope of OpenCRVS.

Run **Ctrl+C** **twice** in the **opencrvs-core** window in the **top right**, to quit all docker containers.  Run `docker ps` to ensure all have stopped.   If any are still running, you will have to force stop all docker containers before continuing.
