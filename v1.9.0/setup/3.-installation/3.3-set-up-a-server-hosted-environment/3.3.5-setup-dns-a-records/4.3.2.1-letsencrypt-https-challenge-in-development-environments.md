# 4.3.2.1 LetsEncrypt https challenge in development environments

### LetsEncrypt HTTPS Challenge

Traefik config is required to be edited in your docker-compose files for your environment listed [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/tree/develop/infrastructure).

If you are provisioning a **development** environment for learning purposes **outside of a VPN**, then this block is all you need in order to configure the LetsEncrypt HTTPS challenge mechanism for SSL cert generation.
