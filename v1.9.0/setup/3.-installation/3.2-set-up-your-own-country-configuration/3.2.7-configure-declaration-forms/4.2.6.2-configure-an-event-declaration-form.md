# 4.2.6.2 Configure an event declaration form

* Define the structure of the form into pages using defineDeclarationForm
* Build each page from the available form fields, validations, conditionals etc

## Define form structure using `defineDeclarationForm()`

In the v2 events engine, every event must declare its **Declaration Form** — the form a registrar completes when declaring the event (birth, death, marriage, etc.).

To make this easier and strongly typed, OpenCRVS provides the helper:

```ts
defineDeclarationForm(...)
```

This constructs a **validated, typed declaration form configuration** that can be assigned to:

```ts
declarationForm: defineDeclarationForm({...})
```

inside your `EventConfigInput`.

***

## 1. What `defineDeclarationForm()` does

`defineDeclarationForm()`:

* Ensures your declaration form follows the required v2 structure
* Guarantees consistent typing for pages, groups and fields
* Applies Zod validation so invalid form structures fail at service startup rather than in production
* Produces the exact shape the events engine expects in `EventConfigInput`

It’s essentially a **form builder** with strong compile-time and runtime validation.

***

## 2. Structure of `defineDeclarationForm()`

It accepts a single config object:

```ts
defineDeclarationForm({
  label: TranslationConfig,
  pages: PageConfig[]
})
```

Let’s break down the example:

```ts
defineDeclarationForm({
  label: {
    defaultMessage: 'Death declaration form',
    id: '',
    description: ''
  },

  pages: [deathIntroduction, deceased, eventDetails, informant, documents]
})
```

***

## 3. `label` — The translated heading of the form

```ts
label: {
  defaultMessage: 'Death declaration form',
  id: '',
  description: ''
}
```

This is a **TranslationConfig** object.

It defines the name that appears at the top of the declaration flow.

#### Important notes:

* `defaultMessage` is what appears in English (or fallback language)
* `id` should be a proper translation key (e.g. `"event.birth.declarationForm.label"`)
* `description` is for translators

This label is shown in various parts of the UI, including on page headers.

***

## 4. `pages` — The ordered list of pages in the declaration form

```ts
pages: [deathIntroduction, deceased, eventDetails, informant, documents]
```

The array contains **Page Config Objects**, each representing a “page” of the declaration form.

#### A **Page** represents:

* One screen in the UI
* Containing one or more **groups**
* Each group containing one or more **fields**

Pages are defined separately (e.g. in `deathIntroduction.ts`, `deceased.ts`, etc.) so you can re-use them or swap them between events.

#### Why the order matters

The order you put the pages in this array determines how the registrar navigates the form:

1. `deathIntroduction`
2. `deceased`
3. `eventDetails`
4. `informant`
5. `documents`

The form wizard/navigation follows this order exactly.

***

## 5. What a page looks like

A page config typically looks like:

```ts
export const deceased = definePage({
  id: 'deceased',
  label: { id: '...', defaultMessage: 'About the deceased' },
  groups: [
    defineGroup({
      id: 'identity',
      label: { ... },
      fields: [ firstName, lastName, sex, dateOfBirth ]
    }),
    defineGroup({
      id: 'documentation',
      fields: [ nationalId, passportNumber ]
    })
  ]
})
```

`defineDeclarationForm()` collects all pages and produces the full declaration form schema.
