# Contributing

This documentation is intended for developers working daily as part of the OpenCRVS Core team, as well as external contributors who wish to contribute occasionally.

Here youâ€™ll find documentation on our best practices, developer workflows, and the automation we use for feature development, bug fixing, and other day-to-day development tasks.
