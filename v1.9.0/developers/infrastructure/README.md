# Infrastructure

The OpenCRVS infrastructure setup includes:

* **Ansible-based server provisioning automation** that transforms bare Ubuntu servers into production-ready application and backup servers.
* **Configuration files** for deploying services on Docker Swarm.
* **Deployment automation pipelines** implemented with GitHub Actions.

If you are deploying OpenCRVS for your country, it is critical to understand and adapt these processes and configurations to align with your government's IT environment.
