# 7. Search for a record

Civil registration systems must be able to store, file, archive and retrieve records. OpenCRVS enables users to search by a number of different criteria, reducing the search scope for a better user experience.

### **Pre-condition**

A record exist in the system with the status ‘In review’, ‘Validated’, ‘Registered’, ‘Requires Updates’, ‘Registered’, ‘Certified’, ‘Issued’, ‘Archived’

### **Triggers**

* A user `scope:search[event=event]` can search for all event records
* A user `scope:search[event=event my-jurisdiction]` can search for event records only in their jurisdiction

### **Standard flow**

1. User choose the type of search (Tracking ID, Registration No. National ID, Phone number)
2. User enters in search query
3. If user has a connection then the system will process the search query
4. Any results are displayed

### **Post conditions**

* User can then choose to assign themselves to the record and complete the required action
* User can choose to view the record audit for the record
* User can choose to view the record (read only)

### **Variations/Exceptions**

If the user does not have a unique identifier such as a tracking ID or registration no. then they can use **Advanced search**.

Advance search lets you search for a record by:

* Record status eg. Registered or Issued
* Place of registration
* Date of registration
* Using different event parameters configured to be searchable. eg. Child, Mother or Fathers details
