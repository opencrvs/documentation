# Functional Architecture

OpenCRVS 1.9 is a marjor rewrite to support the configuration of any number of civil events with existing core, support and admin functions.\
\
It is seen as a stepping stone to supporting in OpenCRVS 1.10 (with this a new functional architecture will be shared):

* custom business process record workflows (eg. attestation, seniro approvals, escalations)
* hierarchy of offices and jurisdictions (control what records users can view and action)
* verifiable credentials&#x20;
