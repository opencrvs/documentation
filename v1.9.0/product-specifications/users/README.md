# User roles & scopes

OpenCRVS supports the creation of multiple custom users with specific permissions (scopes) to control what they can and cannot do in the system. This feature allows countries to define user roles and their corresponding scopes based on their specific needs.

### Key Features

**Unlimited user role configuration**: Administrators can create and configure any number of system user roles.

**Custom role naming**: Each user role can have a custom name (e.g., _Healthcare Worker, Mayor, Registrar_).

**Scope-based permissions**: The functionalities available to each user role can be controlled by assigning specific scopes

### User Role Scopes

The following are the key scope categories available for configuration:
