# 15. Deduplication

OpenCRVS employs a robust matching algorithm, leveraging the capabilities of ElasticSearch. By automatically detecting potential duplicates, OpenCRVS prompts the Registrar to carefully review these declarations before proceeding with the registration process.&#x20;

This proactive approach ensures that duplicate records are promptly addressed and minimises the chances of duplicate civil registration records from existing.&#x20;

### **Pre-condition**

Declaration status is Notified, Declared or Validated

### **Triggers**

* User with `scope:record.declare[event=event]` sends complete declaration for review
* User with `scope:record.declared.vlaidate[event=event]` starts and sends declaration for approval
* User with `scope:record.register[event=event]` starts and then registers a declaration

### **Standard flow**

1. Each trigger action listed above prompts a deduplication check
2. If deemed a potential duplicate the declaration will show in the Ready for review workqueue for a user with `scope:record.review-duplicates`
3. User assigns themselves to the potential duplicate declaration
4. User clicks “Review”
5. User is prompted to check the potential duplicate declaration against matched records
6. User clicks on the tab of a flagged record
7. User compares the potential duplicate declaration against the matched record side by side
8. User reviews any other matched records
9. User returns to the potential duplicate declaration view after making an assessment
10. User clicks “Not a duplicate”
11. User confirms their decision

### **Post conditions**

* Declaration status remains ‘Declared’ and in Ready for Review workqueue.
* Record audit is updated to show that the declaration was marked not a duplicate

### **Variations/Exceptions**

* User clicks “Mark as a duplicate”
