# 4.2.5.1.1 Informant and staff notifications

#### 📣 Notifications & Messaging in OpenCRVS

In a **production environment**, OpenCRVS sends automated notifications to **staff** and **informants** at key points in the registration workflow.\
In **development** and **QA environments**, messages are _disabled by default_ to prevent accidental delivery.

You can fully customise:

* Supported communication channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.)
* Message languages and localisation
* Message content and frequency
* Integration providers (e.g., Infobip, SendGrid)

The Farajaland example includes:

* **SMS integration** using _Infobip_
* **Email integration** using _SendGrid_

***

#### 🔁 Event Notification Flow

All event-related notifications pass through the [**`onAnyActionHandler`**](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/0fc50a9d21d2c7525e5b8e3b8f1cd7c0ca7a7328/src/index.ts#L657) endpoint in _countryconfig_.\
This handler is triggered whenever an event changes status (e.g., **VALIDATED → REGISTERED**).

From this handler, the logic routes into a shared [**`notify`**](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/0fc50a9d21d2c7525e5b8e3b8f1cd7c0ca7a7328/src/api/notification/handler.ts#L143) method where you can:

* Decide which messages to send
* Apply localisation
* Choose communication channels
* Customise timing or suppress notifications

This is the central place to configure message behaviour for your country implementation.

***

#### 📧 Email Templates

Email messages are written in **HTML** and can be fully customised.

* Templates are located in the email [templates](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/tree/develop/src/api/notification/email-templates) directory
* You may edit them to fit your country’s branding, tone, or regulatory requirements
* For each **custom event type** you introduce, you must create or modify a corresponding template
* The Farajaland configuration includes example templates for **birth**, **death**, and **marriage** events

***

#### 📱 SMS & WhatsApp Templates

SMS templates also support localisation and can be used for **SMS** or **WhatsApp** delivery.

* Templates are stored in the SMS templates [directory](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/translations/notification.csv)
* They are short-text, plain-language versions of notification messages
* For every **custom event type**, you must use or create a matching SMS template
* Farajaland provides sample templates for **birth**, **death**, and **marriage**

#### 📣 Essential staff communications

The following messages are sent to staff **by default**, as they are required for normal OpenCRVS operation.

\
By default, these notifications are delivered **via email**, but SMS equivalents can also be configured.

Below are example SMS versions of these essential staff messages:

<table><thead><tr><th width="142">Message</th><th>Description</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>authenticationCodeNotification</td><td>Received by a staff member when logging in. Used to send the 2FA code for authentication during login <strong>REQUIRED IN PRODUCTION FOR SECURITY REASONS!!</strong> In <strong>development</strong> and <strong>qa</strong> environments, the 2FA code is always six zeros: 000000</td><td>Your OpenCRVS authentication code is: {{code}}</td></tr><tr><td>userCredentialsNotification</td><td>Received by a staff member when their OpenCRVS account has been created by a System Administrator</td><td>Your OpenCRVS account has been created. Please login with your username: {{username}} and temporary password: {{temporaryPassword}}</td></tr><tr><td>retrieveUserNameNotification</td><td>Received by staff when they have forgotten their username</td><td>Your username for OpenCRVS is: {{username}}</td></tr><tr><td>updateUserNameNotification</td><td>Received by staff when a System Administrator has changed their username</td><td>Your OpenCRVS username has been updated to: {{newUsername}}. Your password has not changed.</td></tr><tr><td>resetUserPasswordByAdminNotification</td><td>Received by staff when a System Administrator has changed their password</td><td>Your password has been reset. Please login to {{applicationName}} with the temporary password: {{temporaryPassword}}.</td></tr><tr><td>resetUserPasswordNotification</td><td>Received by staff when they attempt to reset their password</td><td>Use the code {{code}} to reset your {{applicationName}} password. This code expires in 10 minutes.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Essential staff communication endpoints

All notifications related to staff pass through [these](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/config/routes/userNotificationRoutes.ts) routes and should only be carefully modified. Usually these will use Email by default.
