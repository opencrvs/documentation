# 4.2.10 Build Country config docker image

#### 1. Set up an individual and an organisation account on Dockerhub

{% hint style="info" %}
DockerHub account is required as registry for Country config docker image.
{% endhint %}

Firstly, you will need a companion container registry account. Our scripts are hardcoded to use DockerHub, if you need to work with any other private registry, please modify provision and deploy scripts.

You will need a docker container registry [**organisation**](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/orgs/) account on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) to build and push your country configuration container (image) in order to use our scripts. An organisation is required with all of your developers (including yourself) individual accounts added to the organisation's "[members](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/members/)" (or teams) list, so that each developer can access the container.

This is because your full team and all the servers will need access to your forked country config docker container. The servers will use your personal DockerHub credentials to access the container. [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a free containerisation repository that will provide you with 1 free private repository, and that is all you need. You will have to customise our infrastructure scripts if you wish to use a different container registry provider.

Then create an empty private repository to store your configuration...

Ensure that the DockerHub members have permissions to write to the repository:

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need your DockerHub **username** and a personal DockerHub account **access tokens** in order to create the Github environment. Our scripts use these credentials to login to DockerHub programmatically. This is how you create a DockerHub access token: [https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/)
{% endhint %}

#### 2. Configure Country config repository to work with DockerHub Account

Add following secrets to Country config repository:

| `DOCKERHUB_ACCOUNT` | The name of your Dockerhub account or organisation that forms the URL to your country config docker image on Dockerhub _**before**_ the slash. e.g: **opencrvs**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOCKERHUB_REPO`    | The name of your Dockerhub repository that forms the URL to your country config docker image on Dockerhub _**after**_ the slash.. e.g. **ocrvs-farajaland**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `DOCKER_TOKEN`      | Your [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) access token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `DOCKER_USERNAME`   | <p>Your <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Dockerhub</a> username to access the container registry. If you are using a different container registry, you will need to manually edit the deploy.yml at OpenCRVS Countryconfig repository appropriately.<br>NOTE: Dockerhub is used to store only OpenCRVS Countryconfig docker images. All Core images are stored in GitHub Packages</p> |
