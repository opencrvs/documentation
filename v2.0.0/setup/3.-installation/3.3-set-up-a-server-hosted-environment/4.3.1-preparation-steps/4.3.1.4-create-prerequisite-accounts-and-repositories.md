# 4.3.1.4 Create prerequisite accounts and repositories

### 1. Ongoing costs of additional services

OpenCRVS is hardcoded to use the following 3rd party services which require subscriptions. The cost of these services is negligible, industry standard and promotes best practice developer operations experience.

1. A docker container registry [**organisation**](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/orgs/) account on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) for hosting OpenCRVS Country config images.
2. An organisation Github account in a minimum of a ["Team"](https://github.com/pricing) plan to configure automated provisioning and deployment.
3. System alerts can be broadcast to an email address. It's usually important that alert notifications are not silo-ed to a single individual for auditing purposes, therefore it is optional, but recommended to have a team messaging system such as Slack to receive these notifications: A Slack Pro account [https://app.slack.com/plans](https://app.slack.com/plans)
4. Application bug reports can be delivered to a [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) Team account. A free plan is fine for development / proof-of-concept, or if you are less worried about report volume and longevity.
5. Critical server secrets and passwords are created when initialising an environment and creating National System Admin users.  A password manager such as 1Password Team [https://1password.com/business-pricing](https://1password.com/business-pricing) or Bitwarden Team [https://bitwarden.com/pricing](https://bitwarden.com/pricing) is an industry standard location to store such secrets safely, providing sufficient governance.

### 2. Set up an individual and an organisation account on Dockerhub

{% hint style="info" %}
A DockerHub account is required as the registry for the countryconfig docker image.
{% endhint %}

You will need your DockerHub **username** and a personal DockerHub account **access tokens** as secrets. Our scripts use these credentials to login to DockerHub programmatically. This is how you create a DockerHub access token: [https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/)

Please check [4.2.10 Build Country config docker image](../../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/4.2.10-build-country-config-docker-image.md) for more information.

### 3. Create companion service accounts for monitoring and notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
This step optional, but recommended
{% endhint %}

Our code includes optional integration with [Sentry](https://www.sentry.io) for error tracking. To take advantage, create a NodeJS project in Sentry for the environment you want to monitor.

In the Sentry project settings, select "Client Keys", and **copy the DSN property**. You will use this as the `SENTRY_DSN` secret later.

Any service error whether caught or uncaught will be visible in application logs that you can monitor in Kibana. Any hardware alert will be broadcast via elastalert to an email account configured using the `ALERT_EMAIL` environment secret.

If you wish to collate service and hardware errors into a single location you can configure Sentry Alert Rules and email forwarding from `ALERT_EMAIL` to the same location, such as a Slack Channel.

The benefits of using Slack, are that your entire development and quality assurance team can receive these notifications without a single individual becoming a bottleneck.

Notifications are sent by email by default, so you should configure SMTP settings. The `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` environment secret stores the email address used as the sender for automated system emails.

SMS gateway information can be configured in secrets too, but you will be required to follow the code in order to do this yourself.

### 4. Fork (or clone) repositories

Create your own forks from the following repositories:

* [https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig): Repository is used to store OpenCRVS Country configuration. More information how to fork and configure repositories was described here, when forking the countryconfig repo: [4.2.1 Fork your own country configuration repository](../../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.1-fork-your-own-country-configuration-repository.md)
* [https://github.com/opencrvs/infrastructure](https://github.com/opencrvs/infrastructure): Repository is used to store Infrastructure and CI/CD configuration (ansible inventory files and helm release values).

**Steps to fork infrastructure repository:**

1. Go to [https://github.com/opencrvs/infrastructure](https://github.com/opencrvs/infrastructure)
2. In the top right corner press "Fork" button
3. Provide "Owner" and "Repository name" values
4. Press "Create fork" button.
5. Create a [Github Personal Access Token ](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)with the required permissions in order for the script to programmatically create Github environments on your forked repository. The only required scope for the token is "repo".

{% hint style="warning" %}
Set the token expiration time as needed. Keep in mind that the token secret must be updated regularly for deployment actions to continue working after it expires.
{% endhint %}
