# 4.3.1.3 Issue SSL Certificates

There are a number of ways you can configure TLS / SSL certificates for OpenCRVS. The options are explained in subsequent pages and all methods must be compatible with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/overview/).



**Free LetsEncrypt certificates**

A free approach is to use LetsEncrypt. However LetsEncrypt certificates must validate and refresh every 3 months. When installing OpenCRVS behind a VPN, **required for production and staging environments**, your VPN and DNS settings must be configured to enable this, and some techniques may not work in your network.&#x20;

For more information see official documentation [https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/)



**Purchasing long term certificates**

Most government networks require you to purchase a long term SSL certificate per environment, and manually replacing the static .crt & .key files every 1, 2 or 3 years depending on it's lifetime.&#x20;

The SSL certificates that you purchase must support the subdomains and each environment's domain: **qa, production & staging, see previous section** [4.3.1.2-configure-dns.md](4.3.1.2-configure-dns.md "mention"). You may opt for a single, multi-domain, wildcard SSL certificate that covers all of your domains regardless of the number of subdomain levels.&#x20;

You need to pay close attention to your domain and DNS requirements to understand which SSL certificate to purchase.

OpenCRVS configuration script automatically handles following SSL Certificates:

* LetsEncrypt https challenge in development environments
* Static TLS certificates



**Example "recipes"**

The following "recipes" are not meant to be exhaustive, but simply describe some examples you may wish to follow. Every country will have unique network, domain name & management considerations to pay attention to.
