# 4.3.1.1 Setup infrastructure

### Data Center

OpenCRVS should only be provisioned on servers located in an equivalent minimum of a [certified Tier 2 or 3 Datacenter](https://uptimeinstitute.com/tier-certification/tier-certification-list).

Implementers should refer to the “Uptime Institute” design documents for specific requirements associated with Tier 2 & 3 certification. At a high-level, the datacenter should have:

* Uninterrupted power supply with independent, backup power generation
* Air conditioning
* 24/7 security access for authorised technical staff only
* Automatic server backup off-site
* Failsafe internet connectivity
* Security policies and procedures in place
* Network administrator staff capable of configuring and maintaining a scalable VPN solution

We appreciate that connectivity is a challenge in many countries where we work. The data centre should have **an absolute minimum of a 10Mbps internet connection** to the servers otherwise deploying to the servers will be unworkable.

### Server environments

Before proceeding to discuss server specifications, it is important to understand the following server environment glossary that we will be referring to in our example countryconfig reference implementation and further sections.

| Environment                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Authentication                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **production**                        | A live environment containing citizen data e.g: personally identifiable information (PII).                                                                                  | 2FA codes generated for production user access                      |
| **staging** (pre-production / mirror) | A mirror of a live environment, used for final Quality Assurance of a production deployment containing a daily restored backup of citizen data (PII) from the previous day. | 2FA codes generated for production user access                      |
| **qa**                                | A quality assurance environment for tester, trainer & developer use supporting the Quality Assurance of releases, training staff.                                           | Test 2FA codes of 6 zeros allow test user access.                   |
| **backup**                            | A low specification environment that simply stores encrypted backups from production for long term recovery.                                                                | Not applicable. OpenCRVS software does not run on this environment. |
| **development**                       | An environment you can use for training and development purposes only. NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!!                                                                             | Test 2FA codes of 6 zeros allow test user access.                   |

Before proceeding to discuss network specifications, it is important to understand the following other concepts:

* **vpn:** All servers must be protected behind a government virtual private network (VPN). Users must authenticate via the VPN to access OpenCRVS in a browser. The country should provide and operate the VPN. When using self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, place those runners inside the VPN or on the internal network so they can reach servers directly; no VPN tunnel from GitHub-hosted services is required.
* **Continuous provisioning & deployment via GitHub Actions:** OpenCRVS provides GitHub Actions workflows for automated provisioning and deployment. A GitHub organisation is required. Self-hosted runners deployed within your VPN/internal network (recommended).
* **bastion** or **jump:** An optional bastion (jump) host can consolidate and control SSH access to servers behind the VPN without distributing VPN credentials. Bastions are useful for administrative SSH access, auditing and as an alternative deployment hop even when using self-hosted runners inside the VPN.

### Server specifications

Refer to these minimum server specifications for the above environments. Note that the hard-disk space specifications are illustrative. Depending on the population size and number of supporting documents that are required to be captured during civil registration business processes, you may require more disk-space. Regardless your system administrators must be capable of monitoring and increasing server disk-space on demand. :

### Minimum server specifications

| Environment (use)                              | Minimum specification                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Notes:

* Disk-space values are minimums and illustrative; adjust based on population, attachments and retention needs.
* Ensure administrators can monitor and expand disk capacity on demand.
* Production clusters should follow recommendations in the "Server clusters by project" section for HA and scalability.

### Ubuntu version

First, login as root, or if you only have sudoer access, do `sudo -i`.

```
riku@farajaland-prod:~$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Release:	24.04
...
```

If not, either recreate the server or upgrade Ubuntu.

### Production / staging / backup disk space requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
Calculated disk space doesn't include space for monitoring and logs. Please check "Monitoring disk space requirements" for more details.
{% endhint %}

Required disk space for production, staging and backup environments is calculated using the expected number of records per year and the estimated average number of attachments. The number of participating locations should be taken into account.

Please use the following formula:\
\
&#xNAN;_&#x61;ttachments\_per\_year = number of births, deaths.. records per year \* average number of attachments \* 0.4MB_

_record\_data\_per\_year = number of births, deaths.. records per year \* 18.33kB_\
&#xNAN;_&#x6F;perating\_system\_requirements = 100GB_

_minimum\_required\_disk\_space = operating\_system\_requirements + record\_data\_per\_year + attachments\_per\_year_

Using an average size country with population of 30M, crude birth rate of 17.299 births per 1000 people and crude death rate of 7.7 per 1000 we can calculate an estimate of records submitted every year\
\
Births per year: 518 970

Deaths per year: 231 000

Number of records per year: 749 970 per year

Choosing an average number of attachments of 3 we can calculate the total space needed per year

Attachments: 749 970 \* 3 \* 0.4 = 899 964 MB or 899 GB

Record data: 749 970 \* 18.33 = 13 746 950 kB or 13.74 GB

Combining that with the minimum disk space reserved for the system, we conclude the minimum required disk space for application servers in this example is 1012.47 GB.

For backup servers, we recommend storage size twice the size of application servers so in this case 2024.94 Gb.

Work is ongoing in OpenCRVS to optimise storage in future versions.

### Monitoring disk space requirements

In default configuration monitoring data is stored for 30 days. Monitoring data size depends on filebeat configuration (scrape frequency, collected metrics, labels, tags). OpenCRVS is using custom filebeat configuration file, optimised to store only valuable data. Average disk size for monitoring data is 200Mb host/day. In general value can be calculated by formula:

```
Total space = 200Mb * <days> * <hosts> + 1Gb * <hosts>
```

* `200Mb`: disk size per day
* `days`: number of days to store logs
* `hosts`: number of hosts to store logs
* `1Gb`: is minimal extra-space for each VM

For single VM at least 7Gb of additional disk space is needed to store monitoring data for 30 days:

```
Total space = 200Mb * 30 * 1 + 1Gb * 1 = 7Gb
```

For Kubernetes cluster with 2 VMs at least 14Gb of additional disk space will be needed:

```
Total space = 200Mb * 30 * 2 + 1Gb * 2 = 14Gb
```

If scrape frequency, collected metrics, labels, tags were adjust then make sure disk size per day value is up to date.

### Logging disk space requirements

Logging data is stored as Elasticsearch index and can be accessed any time in Kibana.

Logging data is generated by few different sources:

* Elastic APM agents installed within critical OpenCRVS components
* OpenCRVS application and datastores logs
* Operating system logs

By default OpenCRVS monitoring helm chart is configured to store data for 1 week only. There is no way to estimate logging data usage, but it's recommended to keep at least 10Gb of disk space for logs.

### Disk layout requirements

By default OpenCRVS stores citizens records, monitoring and logging in `/data` folder. There are few options available to define disk partitioning:

* **Single disk partition**: disk partition mounted as `/` has sufficient space to store all data produced by OpenCRVS. At provision time `/data` folder is created by ansible scripts.
* **Single disk partition with encryption**: same as previous, with encryption enabled OpenCRVS will create encrypted file on disk `/cryptfs_file_sparse.img`, allocate proper file size and mount file as `/data` partition.
* **Dedicated disk partition for data**: System administrator may decide to use dedicated disk partition (e/g LVM, NAS) to store citizens data.
* **Other layouts** are possible, but not supported by OpenCRVS installation scripts. OpenCRVS Dependencies helm chart allows to define other ways to store files by using Kubernetes storage classes, please check helm chart [documentation](https://github.com/opencrvs/infrastructure/tree/develop/charts/dependencies).

**Verify the disk has been partitioned correctly**

We want to ensure the partition mounted to / has enough disk space. OpenCRVS citizen data will be stored in the following location:

```
/data
```

Here is example of disk layout:

```
root@yourserver:~$ df -h
Filesystem           Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda1            311G  32G   280G  67% /
/dev/vda15           105M  6.1M   99M   6% /boot/efi
```

This server has 280GB available after the operating system has been deployed.  You should set aside a further 50-75GB for Docker images.  So only 205GB - 230GB is available.  To use 200GB, you would enter "200g" when prompted.

It is optional to LUKS encrypt this location so that your data is encrypted at rest.  You will be asked if you wish to encrypt and how much server space you should apply to the encrypted disk.

The secret ENCRYPTION\_KEY is used on reboot to decrypt and mount this folder.   To take advantage of this feature, amend the location of the key to a secure location in `infrastructure/server_setup/group_vars/all.yml`:

```yaml
# Disk Encryption key location as an example (in production use a hardware security module)
disk_encryption_key_path: /root/disk-encryption-key.txt
```

{% hint style="success" %}
All the secrets are explained in more detail in the section [4.3.1.1 Environment secrets and variables explained.](../4.3.1-create-a-github-environment/4.3.1.1-environment-secrets-and-variables-explained.md)
{% endhint %}

### Server clusters by project

The number of servers required in a load balanced cluster is configurable depending on the project and population size. Please take note of these recommendations.

#### Proof-of-concept (P.O.C.)

For a proof-of-concept (P.O.C.) of OpenCRVS, we use 1 **qa** server with **no backup**, operating under the condition that no live citizen data is captured during a P.O.C: **qa** x 1

#### Pilot

A total of 4 servers are required for pilot implementations that capture citizen data. One for each environment: **qa** x 1, **production** x 1, **staging** x 1 & **backup** x 1.

#### National scale

For national scale implementations, we recommend deploying to a production server cluster of 2 - 5 production servers depending on population size.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is recommended to deploy the production environment on a cluster of at least 2 servers. This ensures high availability and prevents downtime or data loss in the event of a server failure.
{% endhint %}

| Population size | Servers required                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 30M           | **qa** x 1, **production** x 2, **staging** x 1 & **backup** x 1 |
| 30M - 60M       | **qa** x 1, **production** x 3, **staging** x 1 & **backup** x 1 |
| 60M+            | **qa** x 1, **production** x 5, **staging** x 1 & **backup** x 1 |

### Network

Refer to the following network diagram as a reference example of how to network your server cluster.

### Server administrator SSH access & permissions:

During provisioning, the server administrator requires SSH access through the provided VPN to all servers with **sudo** permissions.

During installation of OpenCRVS, SSH config to all servers will be modified, blocking password based SSH authentication, root user access, configuring 2FA authentication and alerting for all future SSH access.

Once provisioned, there should be no need for technical staff to ever SSH into a server during day-to-day operations. Every SSH access going forward is audited via a Slack notification to all technical staff thanks to these provisioned alerts.

### User access

The following users will access 3 of the environments: **qa**, **production** & **staging**, via a VPN client:

1. Existing Civil Registration staff that access the OpenCRVS client using the Chrome browser on desktops/laptops/mobile devices.
2. 3rd party approved government staff (e.g. Healthcare staff in hospitals) that access the OpenCRVS client using the Chrome browser on desktops/mobile devices.
3. Your development and QA team that access the OpenCRVS client using the Chrome browser on desktops/laptops/mobile devices.
4. Potential future automated integrations from approved healthcare services using our [APIs](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/technology/interoperability/event-notification-clients) with VPN access
5. Potential future automated integrations external gov services using our [APIs](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/technology/interoperability/event-notification-clients) with VPN access
6. Automated continuous deployment scripts from a private Github code repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
All user workstations / tablets / smartphones and integrating APIs will require compatible VPN clients and accounts.
{% endhint %}

### Egress (outbound) internet access

In addition to serving user traffic the OpenCRVS infrastructure needs to be able to communicate outbound. This egress traffic includes things like pulling in latest updates, monitoring and emails.

Check that the servers have internet connectivity. The servers must be able to access Dockerhub, Sentry and other internet services such as Ubuntu update repositories, Email & SMS apis for example. Therefore check if you can ping google.com from inside the servers.

If your VPN requires a whitelist of allowed domains, the following are the known domains which the servers require access to:

```
archive.ubuntu.com
changelogs.ubuntu.com
hub.docker.com
auth.docker.io
registry-1.docker.io
download.docker.com
sentry.io
fonts.gstatic.com
storage.googleapis.com
fonts.googleapis.com 
github.com
acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org (if using LetsEncrypt TLS certs)
registry.npmjs.org
registry.yarnpkg.com
eu.ui-avatars.com
... Other domains may be required depending on your configuration
```

### Email (SMTP) server

You must have a working SMTP server and SMTP user details to deploy OpenCRVS. Staff onboarding and monitoring requires an Email service.
