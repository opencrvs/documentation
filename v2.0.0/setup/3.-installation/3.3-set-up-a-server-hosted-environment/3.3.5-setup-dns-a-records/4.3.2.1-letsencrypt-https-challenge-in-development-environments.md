# 4.3.2.1 LetsEncrypt https challenge in development environments

### LetsEncrypt HTTPS Challenge

> [!NOTE] Before Applying changes from this document make sure you already created environment using `yarn environment:init` script, check [Create a github environment](../4.3.4-create-a-github-environment/README.md)

Traefik config is required to be edited in your docker-compose files for your environment listed [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/tree/develop/infrastructure).

If you are provisioning a **development** environment for learning purposes **outside of a VPN**, then this block is all you need in order to configure the LetsEncrypt HTTPS challenge mechanism for SSL cert generation.

```
certificatesResolvers:
  letsencrypt:
    acme:
      tlsChallenge: false
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web
      email: vadym@opencrvs.org
      # Storage for certificates:
      storage: /certificates/acme.json
      # NOTE: Sometimes Let's Encrypt hit production SSL certificate issuing limits
      #       If you are having issues, switch to staging
      # Staging server
      caServer: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
      # Production server
      # caServer: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```
