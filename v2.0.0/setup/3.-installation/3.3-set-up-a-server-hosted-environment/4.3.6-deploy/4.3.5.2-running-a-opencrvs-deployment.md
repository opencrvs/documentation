# 4.3.5.2 Running an OpenCRVS deployment

### Preparation steps

Before you can deploy, you need to make sure that your country configuration Docker image has compiled and has been pushed to your container registry (E.G. Dockerhub). This was explained previously in [Building, pushing & releasing your countryconfig code](/broken/pages/Z8oJyhmScCrPySDyZEyf)

Copy the tag associated with your **countryconfig** Docker container image because you will use it in the next step.

### Run OpenCRVS Deployment

You can deploy to your server using the automated **"Deploy OpenCRVS"** Github Action for any environment created at [Create a GitHub Environment](../../../../../v2.0.0/setup/3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/4.3.4-create-a-github-environment/) step.

1. Navigate to GitHub Actions within `infrastructure` repository
2. Select "Deploy OpenCRVS" action
3. Provide "Tag of the core image" value, usually this value respects to OpenCRVS release, e/g v1.9.0
4. Provide "Tag of the countryconfig image", value should be taken from Country config repository (your forked)&#x20;
5. Select "Target environment" from dropdown menu, all environments created at [4.3.1-create-a-github-environment](../4.3.1-create-a-github-environment/ "mention") step should be listed here.
6. Click Run workflow, and watch the output to make sure that the deployment was successful.

### Verification steps

* Verify workflow was completed successfully
* Verify resources are up and running after deployment: `kubectl get pods -n opencrvs-<env>`&#x20;
*   Make sure all helm pre-/post-deploy hooks completed successfully:<br>

    ```
    kubectl get jobs
    ```
* Access opencrvs in browser: `https://<your domain>` , see [Login to an OpenCRVS server](4.3.5.3-login-to-an-opencrvs-server.md)
