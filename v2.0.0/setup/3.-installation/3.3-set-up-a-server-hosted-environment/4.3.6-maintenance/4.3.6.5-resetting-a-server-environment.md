# 4.3.6.5 Resetting a server environment

### Before you begin

The **Reset environment** Github Action can be used to clear a **development,** **qa and staging** environment of all data. This is useful during testing of environments where you may have made test registrations.

{% hint style="info" %}
After resetting your environment, it contains no data at all. It must be [seeded](4.3.6.2-seeding-a-server-environment.md) again
{% endhint %}

### Run "Reset environment" workflow

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before resetting production environment make sure you have working backup of your data.

In default configuration GitHub action will require at least 3 approvals for Production environment reset.
{% endhint %}

3. Select "Target environment" from dropdown menu, all environments created at [Create a GitHub Environment](../4.3.4-create-a-github-environment/) step should be listed here.
