# 4.3.6.3 Seeding a server environment

### Before you begin

OpenCRVS helm chart seeds data at installation time.

If you need to re-seed data again, please [reset a server environment](4.3.6.5-resetting-a-server-environment.md) before.

If for some reason data seed was not executed at OpenCRVS installation time, please use instructions from this page to seed your database.

### Run "Seed data" workflow

1. Navigate to GitHub Actions within `infrastructure` repository
2. Select "Seed data" action
3. Select "Target environment" from dropdown menu, all environments created at [Create a GitHub Environment](../4.3.4-create-a-github-environment/) step should be listed here.
4. Click "Run workflow" button

If an error occurs, the environment must be reset before it can be seeded again. Resetting an environment is explained [here](4.3.6.5-resetting-a-server-environment.md).
