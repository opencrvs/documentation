# 4.3.6.2 Seeding a server environment

Your servers are deployed, but your OpenCRVS databases are empty if this is your first time deploying. Just as you were required to seed your local development environment with initial reference data, you need to seed your server environment.

Once the environments have been successfully deployed to, they are ready for seeding with your reference data that you prepared locally in [step 3.2](../../../../../v1.9.0/setup/3.-installation/3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration)

Run the **Seed data** Github Action with the same OpenCRVS Core image tag you used in the "Deploy..." actions to seed the databases with your data.

The **Seed data** action can only be run once. If an error occurs, the environment must be reset before it can be seeded again. Resetting an environment is explained [here](4.3.6.5-resetting-a-server-environment.md).
