# 4.1.3 Local environment maintenance

All environment maintenance tasks are performed with `tilt` and `kubectl` commands.

## **Start OpenCRVS**

OpenCRVS on local environment (latop, PC) is managed by Tilt (`Tiltfile`). Depending on your acitivities (Core development, Country configuration or DevOps stuff) you will need to use one of preconfigured scenarios. See previous section.

Use following steps to start OpenCRVS:

1. Navigate to your repository folder
2. Run `tilt up` command to start OpenCRVS and all required services

Use `kubectl get pods -n opencrvs-deps-dev` to track OpenCRVS dependencies startup status

Use `kubectl get pods -n opencrvs-dev` to track OpenCRVS startup status

## **For seeding data and environment reset:**

* Make sure tilt is running and you are connected to local cluster (minikube, docker-desktop, etc)
* Open http://localhost:10350/ in browser
* On the last menubar find `2.Data-tasks` menu group.
* Run appropriate task

## **Stop OpenCRVS**

This command will stop OpenCRVS and delete all resources:

1. Navigate to your repository folder
2. Run `tilt down` command to delete all OpenCRVS resources from Kubernetes cluster.
