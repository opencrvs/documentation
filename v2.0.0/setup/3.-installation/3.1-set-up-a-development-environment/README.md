**Important! Please read**

The following instructions will guide you through setting up a **local development** environment for OpenCRVS on your desktop (laptop), using our fictional country configuration “Farajaland” for development and configuration purposes. To learn how to deploy OpenCRVS to a server host, please refer to Section [3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment](../3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend that you first set up the OpenCRVS Demo configuration on your local machine using our fictional country repository before proceeding to fork and create your own country configuration.

To run OpenCRVS successfully, you should have a working knowledge of Linux/Unix operating systems and be comfortable using the terminal. You should also be familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, and Node.js.

First, [install the required dependencies on your local computer](3.1.1-install-the-required-dependencies.md).
