# 4.1.2 Install OpenCRVS locally

Kubernetes is the easiest option to run OpenCRVS locally on your PC or Laptop and test all features and functionality.
Before running make sure all hardware and software requirements are met.

Once you make sure your development environment is ready for running OpenCRVS we are recommending you start from "For OpenCRVS DevOps" configuration and get familiar with all tools used to deploy OpenCRVS locally (tilt, kubectl, helm). In that particular configuration all docker images are pulled from our registry and OpenCRVS application is starting with Falajaland demo data. No additional actions are needed from your side.


The OpenCRVS team uses [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) to manage the local development environment. Depending on your role and development needs, the following configurations (Tiltfiles) are available:

- [DevOps developers](#for-opencrvs-devops), This basic configuration is designed for Helm chart development. Tilt uses official OpenCRVS release images along with the Farajaland demo data. Docker images are pulled from the OpenCRVS container registry.
- [Country config developers](#for-opencrvs-country-config-developers), In this setup, OpenCRVS Core images are pulled from the OpenCRVS container registry. The Country Config image is built locally using Tilt's live update feature, so your code changes are reflected almost immediately. Typically, youâ€™ll be working with your own fork of the Country Config repository.
- [Core developers](#for-opencrvs-core-developers), This configuration builds OpenCRVS Core images locally with live updates enabled, allowing near-instant reflection of code changes. By default, the Country Config image is pulled from the OpenCRVS container registry. If you maintain your own fork of the Country Config repository and container registry, you should update the Tiltfile to use your own registry.
