# 5. Functional configuration

### Before you start

* You must have first completed all the required steps in [Installation](../../../v1.8.0/setup/3.-installation), particularly:

[3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration](../../../v1.8.0/setup/3.-installation/3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration "mention")

[3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment](../../../v1.8.0/setup/3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment "mention")

* Only a National System Admin can configure these settings
* They are provisioned independently for every environment you are hosting: Staging, QA & Production. You may want to make a new factory reset backup when you are finished to make it easier to deploy to new environments.

This section introduces the configuration steps that your National System Admin will be required to do:

1. Configure the application settings
2. Configure registration time periods and fees
3. Create system users
