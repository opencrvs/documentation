## Limitations per approach

### Let's encrypt with DNS-01 challenge (OpenCRVS >=1.4.0)

1. Country needs to use a DNS provider listed [here](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#providers).
2. Application servers need to be able to make requests to the public internet.

Easiest option to maintain in the long term. Easy to configure.

### Country-provided HTTPS certificate

1. Typically costs \~$100-200 per year

Some knowledge of certificates and confirmation chains required. Needs to be renewed every year or so. This is the typical solution for government software.

### Certificates manually generated with Let's Encrypt

1. Certificate needs to be manually renewed every 3 months.

Somewhat easy to generate the certificates using `certbot` using other provider instead of LE makes more sense thus **not recommended.**

### A domain name that only exists for the VPN users, self-signed certificate

1. Requires an infrastructure expert

Another common option in governmental software.

### Let's Encrypt with HTTP-01 challenge (OpenCRVS <1.4.0)

1. Requires the application HTTP server to be available in the public internet

**Not recommended.**
