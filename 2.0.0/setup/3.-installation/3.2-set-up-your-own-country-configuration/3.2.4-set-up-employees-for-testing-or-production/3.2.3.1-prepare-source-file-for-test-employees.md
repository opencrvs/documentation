# 4.2.3.1 Prepare source file for employees

### 👥 Setting Up Employees

#### 🧪 Test Employees (Development & QA)

Prepare a file named [**`default-employees.csv`**](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/data-seeding/employees/source/default-employees.csv).\
This file contains all the **test employees** who should have initial access to your **development**, **staging**, or **QA** OpenCRVS environments.

In these non-production environments:

* Users are created in an **active** state.
* They are **not required** to:
  * Change their password on first login
  * Set up reset-authentication security questions
*   QA users can always log in using the test **2FA code**:

    ```
    000000
    ```

This setup allows your team to perform end-to-end testing quickly without authentication friction.

#### 🏛️ Production Employee

Prepare a separate file named [**`prod-employees.csv`**](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/data-seeding/employees/source/prod-employees.csv).\
This file should contain **only one user**:

* The **National System Administrator**

In production:

* This user is created in a **pending** state.
* On first login they must:
  * Change their password
  * Set up reset-authentication security questions
* **2FA codes are delivered via email**, not bypassed.
* The CSV password for this user is a **temporary one**.

After the National System Administrator logs in for the first time, they are responsible for creating all other production users.

When creating users in production:

* OpenCRVS generates **random, one-time passwords**
* New users receive these credentials via **email invitation**
* Each user must change their password on first login

### 📄 CSV Format Explained

Use the Farajaland [`default-employees.csv`](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/data-seeding/employees/source/default-employees.csv) file as a reference.

#### Important rules:

* **Do not modify** the header row — the import code depends on those exact column names.
* **Do not use commas** in any cell.
* **Do not include empty rows**.
* Each CSV row represents **one unique user** in your country.

#### Column details:

| Column              | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **primaryOfficeId** | The office id in your crvs-facilities.csv row associated with the office where the user works.                               |
| **givenNames**      | The user’s first and middle names, separated by spaces.                                                                      |
| **familyName**      | The user’s family name(s), separated by spaces.                                                                              |
| **role**            | Must match a role ID defined in your custom roles & scopes configuration.                                                    |
| **mobile**          | Mobile number with country code. Must match the phone number regex you plan to enforce. (Optional if SMS/phone is not used.) |
| **username**        | A unique username for login.                                                                                                 |
| **email**           | A valid email address for password resets and 2FA.                                                                           |
| **password**        | Initial login password. Test users log in directly; production users must change this immediately.                           |

### ✍️ Digital Signatures

Some users — usually **civil registrars** — may have their signature printed digitally on certificates.

You can upload a signature image at any time by editing the user in the **Team** section of the OpenCRVS UI.

#### Preparing signature files:

* Use a **transparent PNG** for best results.
* If you need a PNG editor, free online tools can help you:
  * Remove backgrounds
  * Export a transparent PNG
