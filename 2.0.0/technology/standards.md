# Standards

**We implement as per the U.N. Guidelines for Civil Registration.**

Because OpenCRVS is a core component of Digital Public Infrastructure, we are committed to adopting digital gov data standards.

**Social protection standards:** [**Digital Convergence Initiative**](https://spdci.org/events/crvs-and-sp-mis-standards-released-v1-0-0/)**.** OpenCRVS are a [Standards Committee Member ](https://standards.spdci.org/standards/v/crvs-v1.0-1/resources/standards-committee)of the Digital Convergence Initiative, [CRVS and SP-MIS](https://standards.spdci.org/standards/v/crvs-v1.0-1/crvs/crvs-with-sp-mis-standards) interfaces. We helped author these standards and interoperate with social protection systems such as [OpenSPP](https://openspp.org/).

**DPI standards:** [Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure](https://cdpi.dev/) - [G2PConnect](https://g2pconnect.global/) standards are in use in the interoperable [middleware](https://github.com/opencrvs/dci-crvs-api) relevant to the social protection standards above.

**Healthcare standards:** Event registrations such as births and deaths, that occur in a hospital setting can interoperate with OpenCRVS using [FHIR](https://hl7.org/FHIR/) , a global healthcare standard managed by: [Health Level Seven International (HL7)](http://hl7.org/). We have extended FHIR's model to include custom codes and extensions that assist the Civil Registration context.
