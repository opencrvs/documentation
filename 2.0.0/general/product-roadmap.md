# Roadmap

## The OpenCRVS Use Case Inventory

We often get the question "What does OpenCRVS do?". Beyond the descriptions found in the [functional-architecture.md](../product-specifications/functional-architecture.md "mention") section, we maintain a full inventory of use cases, which will allow you to quickly map existing and future use cases supported by OpenCRVS with your own country requirements.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/OpenCRVS Use Cases Inventory.xlsx" %}

In addition to the functional and integration use cases, a separate tab includes non-functional requirements (NFRs) that we believe are important for national scale civil registration systems, the majority of which OpenCRVS is already compliant with.

## Future release dates

The following table provides an overview of projected delivery dates for future releases, as defined in the Use Case Inventory above.

* The beta release is typically made available after initial QA testing, but before full regression testing has been commenced. It is not intended for live use in a production environment, however it allows accredited implementation partners to test out sample configurations and to contribute to the release testing effort.
* All dates provided are indicative and are subject to change, however OpenCRVS Product Management makes every effort to provide accurate estimates to support implementation planning.

<table><thead><tr><th width="148">Release</th><th>Beta release date</th><th>Full release date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>v1.8.0</td><td>28 April 2025</td><td>21 July 2025</td></tr><tr><td>v1.9.0</td><td>05 September 2025</td><td>31 October 2025*</td></tr><tr><td>v2.0</td><td>27 March 2026</td><td>8 May 2026</td></tr></tbody></table>

\*Date adjusted to include configuration and migration testing beyond the Farajaland default, including country reference implementations to ensure known local contexts are supported

## Future product scope

The scope for future releases of OpenCRVS is primarily determined based on confirmed system requirements coming from current and future OpenCRVS implementations.
