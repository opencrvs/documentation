# Users

The different user roles in the system, and defined below, reflect common actors involved in civil registration services around the world as well as non-traditional actors that may help improve service delivery e.g. field agents who can take services to the community.

**System Roles and User types**\
\
OpenCRVS has set roles with defined responsibilities in the system. You can create different user types based on your requirements and map them to these system roles. \
\
For example in Farajaland there are four different Field Agents user: Healthcare Worker, Police Office, Local Leader, Social Worker. They are different users but all have the same responsibilities in the system.
{% endhint %}

* The user types for Farajaland have been included as an example of how you can map different users with the same responsibilities to the system role.
* To see how these actors work together to improve service delivery in Farajaland, see [business-process-flows-in-farajaland.md](../../default-configuration/business-process-flows-in-farajaland.md "mention").
