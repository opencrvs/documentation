# 12. Deduplication

OpenCRVS employs a robust matching algorithm, leveraging the capabilities of ElasticSearch. By automatically detecting potential duplicates, OpenCRVS prompts the Registrar to carefully review these declarations before proceeding with the registration process. This proactive approach ensures that duplicate records are promptly addressed and minimises the chances of duplicate civil registration records from existing.
