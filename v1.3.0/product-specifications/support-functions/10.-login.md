# 10. Login

Secure device access is critical when working with personally identifiable information.

Users verify their identity by entering their credentials (username and password). This ensures that only authorised users can access the app and the data it contains.

Two Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication. This is a verification code sent to their mobile device or email depending on the system configuration, in addition to their login credentials. This helps prevent unauthorised access even if a user's login credentials are compromised.
