# Business process flows in Farajaland

There are 3 main service delivery models employed in Farajaland to provide effective civil registration services to the public. These service delivery models are as follows:

1. Declaration of a vital event at the community level via a community leader
2. Notification of a vital event from the health facility or hospital through an automated feed from the health system
3. Direct registration at the District Registration Office

For each of the service delivery models a digitally enabled business process has been defined that supports the model.
