# 7.4 Setting up alerts

All alerts and thresholds can be managed through **Management -> Stack Management -> Alerts and Insights -> Rules and Connectors.** OpenCRVS comes with a set of preconfigured alerts, but we recommended these alerts be customised to your country's needs.

Currently, OpenCRVS supports email alerts out of the box. Other types are available by customising your country config package.

#### **Preconfigured alerts**

| Type  | Description                                    | Rule  |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Alert | CPU load on any node                           | >70%  |
| Alert | Service error                                  | >0    |
| Alert | Available disk space on encrypted data storage | <30 % |

### Setting up a new alert

Basic instructions for setting up alerts can be found from Kibana documentation under [Alerts and rules](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/apm-alerts.html#apm-alerts).

It is important to use "Index" as the connection type when setting up new alerts. This option instructs Kibana to write alerts to an Elasticsearch index from where other tools can get notified about errors happening in the system.

Our alerting tool [Elastalert2](https://github.com/jertel/elastalert2) reads alerts from a preconfigured index named `kibana-alert-history-default` and is configured to send an email to `ALERT_EMAIL` email address. This email address can be changed as part of [deployment](../3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/3.3.6-deploy-automated-and-manual.md).
