# 3.2.8.1 Clearing your local development environment database

During development, you may wish to clear your local database so that you can seed it again with new files.

1. Ensure that opencrvs-core is running.
2. Open a new terminal window and cd into your opencrvs-core directory
3. Run the following command:

```
yarn db:clear:all
```

It is also possible to clear and re-seed a server following these [**destructive actions**](../../3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/3.3.7-seeding-and-clearing-data-on-a-server.md).
