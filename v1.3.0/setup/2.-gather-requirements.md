# 2. Gather requirements

In order to configure the OpenCRVS product, you will need a number of inputs. These requirements are listed below and templates provided where relevant. Gather these requirements in advance to make sure you have everything you need before you get started.

### Checklist

*   [ ] **Rules and regulations for civil registration in your country**\
    These will be used to inform configuration parameters such as the legally stipulated timeframe to register a vital event, questions you must ask in the forms (supporting document requirements etc.)&#x20;

    {% hint style="info" %}
    **Note.** rules and regulations should help a country achieve universal civil registration, not get in the way. A comprehensive review of all CRVS rules and regulations should be conducted as part of analysis to inform effective digitised civil registration services - this may mean reform is required as part of a digital transformation programme.
    {% endhint %}



* [ ] **Administrative structure and areas**\
  This will be used ensure that the correct administrative structure is in place to enable registration workflows and effective reporting. [Complete this CSV template.](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/reqs-gathering-templates/Administrative%20Structure.xlsx)



*   [ ] **Statistical reference data**

    Population statistics and crude birth and death rates are required to be able to calculate completeness rates using accurate estimates of the number of vital events occurring. For increased accuracy these are required over time and by location. [Complete this CSV template.](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/reqs-gathering-templates/Administrative%20Statistics.xlsx)



* [ ] **Registration office and health facilities**\
  This will be used to populate the product with reference data for these offices. Complete this CSV template for [offices](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/reqs-gathering-templates/CRVS%20Offices.xlsx) and this for [facilities](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/reqs-gathering-templates/Health%20Facilities.xlsx).



* [ ] **Translation**\
  If you will offer the product in multiple languages, you need to translate the English copy into these languages in advance of configuration. You can edit all the copy for the login application [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/api/content/login/login.json), the client application [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/api/content/client/client.json) and the notification messages [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/develop/src/api/content/notification/notification.json).



* [ ] **Existing birth and death declaration forms**\
  Get hold of the existing registration forms and consider how you could optimise them for the digital world. &#x20;



* [ ] **Re-design vital event certificates**\
  You can add your certificates by uploading an SVG file of the document. When using a digital system, you can re-design vital event certificates to look good and be fit for purpose including innovations such as QR codes. Don't just digitise a paper certificate that wasn't designed with digital in mind.



* [ ] **Government logo**\
  You can make the product look and feel like yours by uploading a logo to appear throughout the product.&#x20;



* [ ] **Business process maps (as-is and to-be)**\
  Understanding the current challenges and how future processes (enabled by technology) can overcome these, is critical to a successful transformation of your civil registration services. These processes will inform which users do what in your country.  Using the CRVS Digitisation Guidebook ([http://www.crvs-dgb.org/en/](http://www.crvs-dgb.org/en/)) can help you conduct business process analysis as well as a number of other activities that effectively prepare for CRVS digitisation.
