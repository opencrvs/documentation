# v1.3.0: Release notes

{% hint style="success" %}
v1.3.0 release includes some exciting new functionality and architectural improvements. This core release is to be used in conjunction with a forked country configuration release v1.3.0\


Upgrading from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0 requires the upgrade [Migration Notes](v1.2.-to-v1.3.-migration-notes/) to be followed precisely.
{% endhint %}

## New in 1.3

OpenCRVS 1.3 represents a major release of new functional features and technical improvements. The following explains in more detail each major feature that has been included in this release.

### Marriage registration - BETA&#x20;

_A new vital event can now be registered. Marriages!_\
\
Customise you marriage form to start registered marriages (Farajaland default captures bride and grooms details, place of event details, informant details, witness details and signatures for up two witnesses aswell as the bride and grooms). \
\
As with birth and death. We offer an API search for marriage events and the ability to create a custom marriage certificate.

{% hint style="info" %}
**BETA release**\
Outstanding marriage related functionality to be built includes:  \
\- Searching for marriage events in the UI\
\- Marriage performance analytics\
\- Configurable marriage fees\
\- Marriage corrections\
\- Notification of intent to marry form.\
\
Due to this, we are releasing marriage registration in "beta", therefore not for production use. You can [configure marriage registration](../../default-configuration/opencrvs-configuration-in-farajaland/application-settings.md) in development environments for proof of concept testing.
{% endhint %}

### Track issuance&#x20;

_Printing certificates off in advance of issuance? Now you can track when they have been issued to the informant._ \
\
It is important to track when a legal document such as a brith certificate has been issued to the informant. So if registration offices are bulk printing certificates in advance of collection by the informant. The issuance of these certificates can be tracked and audited. Providing a proof that paper certificates get into the hands of beneficiaries. \
\
A new workqueue. Ready to issue logs all records with a certificate printed off in advance. This feature can bee configured on/off.&#x20;

</div>

### Verify a certificate via QR code

_Unsure of a paper certificate authenticity? Now you can compare against civil event record, recorded in your Civil Registration database_

A unique QR code on the certificate when scanned by an authorised user can view partial record data. This allows them to compare the data recorded on the certificate against the data in the system to validate it's authenticity. \
\
The QR code contains a unique identifier, the "**recordId**", which via the Record Search API can also be programatically validated by trusted external systems, returning vital event records associated.



### Informant signature&#x20;

_Capture a digital signature of the informant to get their consent to submit an event declaration_

After a declaration has been completed an informant can review the declaration an then an added their signature. As a digital signature directly into the application or an image of a wet signature can be uploaded. \
\
You can [configure the informant signature](../../default-configuration/opencrvs-configuration-in-farajaland/application-settings.md) capture on and off for birth and death events. By default marriage events require the participant and witness signatures.

###

### Email notifications&#x20;

_Choose between SMS or email to send registration status updates to the informant and users_

Informants can now receive email notifications when their declaration has been reviewed, sent for approval and registered. \
\
Users can now receive system notification such as two factor authentication codes via email.  \
\
The email template is completely customisable so you can choose the messaging and the look and feel. &#x20;

### Data visualisation dashboards&#x20;

_View performance data with interactive data visualisations!_

In addition to our performance reports that give you the headline indicator of registration rates, completeness rates etc. You can now choose to view and analyse performance with data visualisations. Powered by the OpenSource Business Intelligence engine [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/).&#x20;

### De-duplication improved&#x20;

_Easily compare side by side a potential duplicate against existing flagged records_

The entire de-duplication user experience has been improved, to be able the user to quickly review potential duplicate records side by side along with supporting documentation. \
\
In real-time a declaration sent for review can be flagged as a potential duplicate (powered by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)s). So that it can easily assessed as a duplicate or not.&#x20;

### MOSIP Integration v2 - E-Signet&#x20;

_Validating identity by continuing our close collaboration with MOSIP_

Our close collaboration with [MOSIP](https://www.mosip.io/) continues in this release with integration from our vital event forms directly into the[ E-Signet](https://docs.esignet.io/) digital identity authentication and consent mechanism.

Using MOSIP [E-Signet](https://docs.esignet.io/) integration, parents and informants can have their IDs validated, and consent to share demographic information to pre-populate the registration form. By combining OpenCRVS and MOSIP

### Plus!

_More application settings are now configurable_

* **Configurable user roles** - can be entirely customised even though they are based on common existing permissions.&#x20;
* **Choose what informant notifications you want to send**
* **Choose a background image or colour for your login splash page**
*

***

## Form configuration refactor

_Deprecation of the form configuration UI_

Responding to country requests to make form configuration more flexible we decided to revert back to a code only approach thus deprecating our form configuration UI. &#x20;

To read more about why we made this decision, refer to our documentation [step 3.2.7 Configure declaration forms](../../setup/3.-installation/3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.7-configure-declaration-forms/)



## API validation

We have improved the API validation for all of our interoperability endpoints and provided extra parameters to improve the power and flexibility of our APIs.



## Dependency upgrades&#x20;

Many dependencies have been upgraded, improving performance, resilience and resolving dependabot security alerts. Our Node version has been upgraded.



## Refactoring the country configuration package&#x20;

Our country configuration package has been entirely refactored. Highlights include:

* Clear directory structure
* Configurable infrastructure and deploy scripts for use on any infrastructure without the requirement to fork opencrvs-core
* Documentation in the code
* More robust API endpoints
* Flexible form configuration via TypeScript - abstraction of complex utilities
* Rapid database seeding process
* Removal of core team internal tools such as cypress tests and data-generator

## Performance improvements&#x20;

Many bugs have been resolved and these are individually listed in the Github release notes.  Significant improvements have been made to download speed when assigning a record.



## **Breaking changes**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Breaking changes - core**\
\
Migration scripts will automatically upgrade your OpenCRVS v1.2 data to be supported in v1.3.  Breaking changes that are not supported by automated migrations, or that require manual steps are listed below.  Follow the [Migration Notes](v1.2.-to-v1.3.-migration-notes/) to migrate between versions of core

* Your countryconfig repository needs to be migrated to the new directory structure.
* Form configuration UI deprecation requires 1.2 users to export their form via JSON and convert to TypeScript using the functions that we provide.
* We have upgraded the password hashing mechanism therefore all users will be required to change their password on first login after the ugrade completes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Breaking changes - country configuration**\
\
The country confguration repository opencrvs-farajaland has been entirely refactored. Please contact us at [team@opencrvs.org](mailto:team@opencrvs.org) if you need any help rebasing changes in this repository.

* You will be required to copy over any changes you made to opencrvs-core infrastructure scripts e.g.: Ansible / deploy.sh into the countryconfig repository.  Hopefully you will appreciate that being able to manage all infrastructure scripts inside the countryconfig repository is a more future-proofed solution than forking opencrvs-core
{% endhint %}



## Documentation updates

The following sections in our documentation have been updated due to the requirements of the new features.

[2 Gather requirements](../../setup/2.-gather-requirements.md)

[3.2 Set-up your own country configuration](../../setup/3.-installation/3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/)

[3.3 Set-up a server hosted environment](../../setup/3.-installation/3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/)

[4 Functional configuration](../../setup/4.-functional-configuration/)



## **Need help migrating to 1.3?**

If you are migrating from an earlier version and if you are working on behalf of a government that is considering implementing OpenCRVS, we can help you to upgrade.

Please contact us at [team@opencrvs.org](mailto:team@opencrvs.org)
