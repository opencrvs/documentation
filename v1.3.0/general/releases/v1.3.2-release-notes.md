### Breaking Changes

â€“

### New features

* Country config can now expose an endpoint for custom tracking ids `POST /tracking-id`. The endpoint receives a FHIR Bundle as a payload and returns a tracking id string. #6093

### Bug fixes

* In large countries, background fetching of statistical data caused the client's initial load to slow down considerably. Preloading now only fetches data for Performance views index page [#6210](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/pull/6342/commits/30eb95a6a1cef3d5f133bec92053cf1ed3607723)
* Deceased's birth year now calculated from their birthday and not the current year #6196
* Users cannot submit a record for review if one of the inputted fields has an invalid date format. Incomplete declarations can still be submitted. This is to prevent invalid values from being sent to the backend.
* Prevent users from going back to "Print certificate" views after they have unassigned themselves from the record.
* Validate user's language string after they login. Use default language if it's an unsupported language.
