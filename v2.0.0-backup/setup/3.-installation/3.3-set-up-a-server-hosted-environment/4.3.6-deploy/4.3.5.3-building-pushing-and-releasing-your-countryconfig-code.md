## 4.3.5.1 Building, pushing & releasing your countryconfig code

When you merge any pull request into the "main", "master" or "develop" branch, or if you explicitly run the "Publish image to Dockerhub" Github Action, a docker container image will be built and pushed to Dockerhub for your **countryconfig** microservice.

Now that you have configured repository secrets for Dockerhub access, you will notice that this action can be successfully run.

If you look at the logs for each build, you can see the image tag associated with the Docker container image. You use this tag in the Deploy action.
