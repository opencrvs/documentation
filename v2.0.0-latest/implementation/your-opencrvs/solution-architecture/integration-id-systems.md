# Integration: ID systems

#### Why integrate OpenCRVS with National ID?

Civil registration provides the source of truth for any vital event that occurs in a country. Civil registration can inform a National ID system when a birth occurs and therefore instigate the generation of a National ID for the child at birth. At the point of death, a civil registration system can inform the National ID system that the person is deceased, thus preventing fraudulent usage of a National ID of a deceased person.

The partnership of Civil Registration and National ID is what collectively constitutes the foundational identity infrastructure of a nation.

#### Which National ID systems can OpenCRVS interoperate with?

OpenCRVS is agnostic regarding which National ID system it integrates with. This section is first organised around the main business use cases.

As of OpenCRVS v1.8.0, OpenCRVS has a production ready integration library dedicated to interoperating with [MOSIP](https://www.mosip.io/)and [E-Signet](https://docs.esignet.io/), fellow OpenSource Digital Public Goods. A dedicated section exists that builds on the same agnostic integration points specifically for integrating with MOSIP.

In the past, OpenCRVS has delivered proof-of-concept (not production ready) integrations with [INGroupe](https://ingroupe.com/) and [OSIA standard](https://secureidentityalliance.org/osia) National ID systems

#### Existing National ID integration functionality

Currently OpenCRVS supports the following default National ID integration functionality:

* Authenticating and verifying the identity of informants and parents during the event application process both offline and online.
* Configurable rules to determine whether or not a civil registration event should or should not integrate with a National ID system at the point of registration.
* Integration with a National ID system at the point of registration synchronously and asynchronously

### 📌 Recommendations on Key Scenarios

***

#### 1. ⚰️ Death Registration & ID Deactivation

#### 🧩 Scenario / Issue

A death is registered in OpenCRVS and triggers interaction with the national ID system regarding the individual’s identifier.

#### ⚠️ Risks

* Immediate ID deactivation may disrupt access to essential services for surviving family members (🏦 banking, 💰 benefits, 🏥 healthcare).
* Downstream systems may act automatically without context or grace periods.
* Loss of trust if families experience sudden service denial following death registration.

#### ✅ Recommendations

* ❌ **Do not automatically deactivate IDs** upon death registration.
* 🚩 Use a **death flag or status indicator** shared with the ID system.
* ⏳ Leave final action (timing and service impact) to relying parties, with **clearly defined grace periods and policies**.
* 📢 Treat death registration as a **notification**, not an automatic enforcement trigger.

***

#### 2. 👶➡️🧑 Updates to Registered Data (Infant vs Adult)

#### 🧩 Scenario / Issue

Civil registration data changes are requested after initial registration (e.g. name corrections, parent details).

#### ⚠️ Risks

* Silent updates to adult identity records can cause mismatches with banks and other relying parties.
* Updates propagated without strong authentication undermine identity assurance.
* Loss of traceability of changes over time.

#### ✅ Recommendations

* 🔍 **Clearly distinguish** between:
  * 👶 _Infant updates_ (pre-biometric)
  * 🧑 _Adult updates_ (post-biometric)
* ✅ Allow OpenCRVS-driven updates **only for infants** where biometrics are not yet captured.
* 🔐 Route adult updates through the **national ID system** using higher-assurance authentication.
* 📝 Maintain **full audit trails** for all updates.

***

#### 3. 🔓 Fetching Demographic Data Without Authentication

#### 🧩 Scenario / Issue

A civil registration office or system requests demographic (biographic) data from the ID system using only an ID number, without authenticating the individual.

#### ⚠️ Risks

* No assurance that the person present is the individual whose data is being fetched.
* Risk of fraud or misattribution (e.g. incorrect parents linked to a child).
* Normalisation of data sharing without consent or verification.

#### ✅ Recommendations

* 🚫 **Do not allow demographic data retrieval** without prior authentication and consent.
* 🔑 Authenticate first (e.g. via **eSignet**), then return approved attributes for pre-population if needed.
* 🏛️ Restrict unauthenticated access to **exceptional, high-assurance government use cases only**, with strong governance.
* 🧭 Make the authentication step **explicit** in both system design and user messaging.

***

#### 4. 🧱 Size & Purpose of the ID Schema

#### 🧩 Scenario / Issue

Countries decide how many attributes are stored in the ID system, ranging from minimal identifiers to extensive personal profiles.

#### ⚠️ Risks

* Large schemas blur the line between an **ID system** and a **population register**.
* Increased privacy and data-protection risk due to data concentration.
* Greater complexity and tighter coupling with downstream systems, making future change harder.

#### ✅ Recommendations

* 🎯 Keep the ID schema **as minimal as possible**, aligned with identification and authentication needs.
* 📚 Treat **civil registration systems as the source of truth** for life events.
* 🔁 Avoid duplicating detailed civil registration data inside the ID platform.
* 🏗️ Be explicit about architectural intent: **Identification service** vs **population register**.

***

#### 5. 🍼📄 Printing a National ID on Birth Certificates

#### 🧩 Scenario / Issue

Countries request that a national identifier (UIN or VID) be printed on birth certificates.

#### ⚠️ Risks

* Over-exposure of foundational identifiers, increasing privacy and misuse risk.
* Confusion between the purpose of a birth certificate (proof of birth) and an ID credential.
* Long-term rigidity if identifiers or policies evolve.

#### ✅ Recommendations

* ❌ **Do not print a national ID by default** on birth certificates.
* 🤔 Only consider printing an identifier where a **clearly defined use case** cannot be met otherwise (e.g. health or social protection).
* 🔗 Prefer **indirect linkage** (e.g. Birth Registration Number linked internally to the ID system).
* 🛡️ If printing is unavoidable, prefer **revocable or masked identifiers** over permanent UINs.

***

#### 6. 🌐🚫 Offline Operation & Authentication Limitations

#### 🧩 Scenario / Issue

Civil registration is conducted offline (especially in remote settings), without real-time authentication or biometric verification.

#### ⚠️ Risks

* Lower assurance of identity at the point of registration.
* Inconsistent handling between offline and online registrations.
* Misaligned expectations of what offline workflows can safely support.

#### ✅ Recommendations

* 📣 Be explicit about **assurance limitations** in offline workflows.
* 🔄 Treat offline operation as **temporary or contextual**, with reconciliation once connectivity is restored.
* 🚧 Avoid extending offline workflows to **high-risk identity actions** (e.g. adult updates).
* 🛣️ Clearly communicate roadmap limitations and future enhancements.
