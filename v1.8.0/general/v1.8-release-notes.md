## v1.8.0: Release notes

#### New features

* **Kubernetes support for local development** Introduced Tiltfile for OpenCRVS deployment on local Kubernetes cluster. Check https://github.com/opencrvs/infrastructure for more information.
* Build OpenCRVS release images for arm devices [#9455](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9455)
*   **New form components**

    * `ID_READER` - Parse the contents of a QR code and pre-populate some fields in the form
    * `HTTP` - Allows making HTTP requests to external APIs. Used in conjunction with `BUTTON` component to trigger the request & the response can be used to pre-populate fields in the form
    * `BUTTON` - Used to trigger actions in the form, such as a `HTTP` component
    * `LINK_BUTTON` - Redirect to a URL when clicked
    * `ID_VERIFICATION_BANNER` - A banner component that can be used to display information about the ID verification process

    More on how these components can be used can be found here: [In-form authentication/verification](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/technology/interoperability/national-id-client/in-form-authentication-verification)

#### Bug fixes

* When the building the graphql payload from form data, we now check if a field was changed. If so then include it in the payload even if it might have been changed to an empty value.[#9369](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9369)

#### Improvements

* Improved text color for disabled text inputs and dropdowns
* **Github runners upgraded** to latest Ubuntu LTS release 24.04 [#7045](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7045)
* **Switch to GitHub Packages** from Docker hub [#6910](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6910)
* **Upgrade Elasticsearch** to a AGPLv3 licensed version 8.16.4 [#8749](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8749)
* **`GH_TOKEN` secret is deprecated** and replaced with `GITHUB_GHCR_PUBLISH_TOKEN` and `E2E_WORKFLOWS_TOKEN` secrets. `GH_TOKEN` secret was widely used within workflows for manipulations with PRs and triggering e2e and deploy workflows in Country config template repositories. We segregated tokens with more restricted access. Please create following secrets in your repository:
  * Secret `GITHUB_GHCR_PUBLISH_TOKEN` is classic token with permissions `repo, write:packages`. Required to build and push OpenCRVS Core images.
  * Secret `E2E_WORKFLOWS_TOKEN` is fine-grained token scoped to your fork of country config template repository with permissions `Contents: Read and Write`.
* Created a standalone `data-seeder` Docker image to decouple seeding logic from the core repository. This improves GitHub Actions runtime by avoiding full repository clone and dependency installation during environment seeding. [#8976](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8976)

## OpenCRVS Country config template v1.8.0

#### New features

* Added a local virtual machine setup for testing Ansible playbooks locally (on MacOS and Ubuntu ). Check [provision.ipynb](v1.8-release-notes/infrastructure/local-development/provision.ipynb) for more details.

#### Improvements

* **Upgrade ELK stack** to a AGPLv3 licensed version 8.16.4 [#8749](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8749)
* Added Build summary and refactored deployment workflow to be more clear [#6984](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6984)
* Build OpenCRVS release images for arm devices [#9455](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9455)
* **Introduced `single_node` variable in inventory files** to define whether single-node clusters are allowed, set to false in production to enforce use of at least a two-node cluster. [#6918](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6918)
* **Github runners upgraded** to latest Ubuntu LTS release 24.04 [#7045](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7045) and apply sticky node version from .nvmrc [#423](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/423)
* Updated `seed-data.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to use the new `data-seeder` Docker image instead of cloning the entire `opencrvs-core` repository. This improves CI performance and simplifies the data seeding process. [#8976](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8976)

#### Bug Fixes

* Added `swarm` tag to all tasks within the `swarm.yaml` playbook, previously it was missing. [#9252](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9252)
* Restrict supported key exchange, cipher and MAC algorithms for SSH configuration [#7542](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7542)
