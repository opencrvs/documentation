## Product councils

The product council includes countries using OpenCRVS and industry experts. The OpenCRVS Core team consults the product council to develop new OpenCRVS functionality by running virtual workshops. Together we explore the requirements for new features such as a Public Portal - so that a solution can be developed that suites all countries. \
