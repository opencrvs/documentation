# v1.3.3: Release notes

### Introduction

[OpenCRVS v1.3.3](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/releases/tag/v1.3.3) is a patch release which includes a hotfix to the previous OpenCRVS v1.3.2 release. It is to be used in conjunction with a forked country configuration release [v1.3.3](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/releases/tag/v1.3.3)

### Breaking Changes

Manually migrating the certificates to explicitly use the "location" handlebar helper would be required when upgrading

### New features

Location certificate handlebars have been update so that they now use ids with a helper to access other properties of the FHIR Location object such as "alias", allowing locations in different languages to be possible on a certificate:

```
{{location districtPlaceofbirthId 'name'}}
```

### Bug-fixes

A bug has been fixed in seeding of locations which occurred when 10000s+ of locations were seeded.&#x20;

Metabase has been upgraded to resolve this zero-day security problem: https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/advisory-metabase-pre-auth-rce-cve-2023-38646
