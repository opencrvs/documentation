# v1.3.1: Release notes

## Introduction

**OpenCRVS v1.3.1** is a minor release which includes a hot-fix to the previous OpenCRVS v1.3.0 release.\
It is to be used in conjunction with a forked country configuration release [v1.3.1](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/releases/tag/v1.3.1)

### Non breaking hotfixes

1. In some countries, informant phone numbers are not captured in the form as the chosen method of beneficiary comms is Email. Therefore the search component in the UI should not offer the option to search by phone number. Now the search UI will dynamically check if either informant email or informant phone number is included in the forms and show "Email" as a searchable parameter in search in place of "Phone" where necessary
2. The FHIR Location API now contains query validation. This is an important security improvement.
3. It is now possible to add signatures for Registration Agents which can appear on the certificates.
4. A collection of bugfixes and minor improvements have also been introduced as outlined in the changelog below
5. Certificate handlebars now enable custom formatting via offering the possibility to create custom [helper](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/block-helpers.html#basic-blocks) functions. An [endpoint](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/d2af4b9894dcd494bd504f46f0bc449742fed7c4/src/index.ts#L341) exists in the country config repository to load in handlebar helper functions. These must be common JS functions with no library dependencies. A basic [example](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/master/src/form/common/certificate/handlebars/helpers.ts) is given. Thanks to this discussion: https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/discussions/5927
6. Dashboard configuration is now possible in Metabase without the requirement to fork Core. A new [endpoint](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/d2af4b9894dcd494bd504f46f0bc449742fed7c4/src/index.ts#L363) exists in the country config repository to load in a customisable [query](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/master/src/api/dashboards/queries.ts) to populate the performance database and additionally, the [Metabase .sql](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/master/src/api/dashboards/file/metabase.init.db.sql) file can be customised to allow any UI change required.
7. Crude birth rates were mistakenly halved in order to calculate male/female gender disaggregation in performance metrics. Crude birth rate is a ratio that is the same for both sexes. A database migration automatically recalculates and updates all crude birth rates to the correct value.

### Breaking hotfixes

1. A new environment variable must be added to Github Actions during deployment: CONTENT\_SECURITY\_POLICY\_WILDCARD. This is supplied to the clients and nginx config like this: \*. and ensures that the format of your domain can be configurable. Previously it was hardcoded in nginx to assume that hostname is the domain name concatenating beyond a dot separated subdomain. Resolved in: https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/pull/6123
