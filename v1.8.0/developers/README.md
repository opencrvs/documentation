  Setting up OpenCRVS for local-development
---
Setting up OpenCRVS locally is the first step for developers to test, customise, and understand the platform before moving to a hosted environment. OpenCRVS provides a comprehensive setup process that allows you to fork the example country configuration (Farajaland), define administrative areas, configure roles and user accounts, and prepare registration offices and health facilities. Using Docker Compose, developers can spin up all core services—such as the API Gateway, client applications, and MongoDB—on their own machine. The local setup supports seeding test data, simulating user roles, and running the platform fully offline, making it ideal for rapid development and exploration​.
