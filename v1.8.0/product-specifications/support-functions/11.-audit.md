# 14. Audit

OpenCRVS's auditing capabilities greatly enhance the accountability of service providers while empowering the detection and mitigation of potential fraudulent activities. It achieves this by storing a detailed log of all actions taken on each record and made viewable to authorised users.

These actions can be scrutinised from two perspectives: the individual record or the user involved. For an extensive overview of audited actions, please refer to [OpenCRVS Specifications 1.4: Audit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jf31WkNMqlfQOYpjpfG73M5utVGrx4zqA5eiODaftNI/edit#gid=759597609)
