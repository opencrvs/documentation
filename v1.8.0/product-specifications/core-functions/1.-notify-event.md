# 1. Notify event

User or external system sends a vital event notification to an assigned office. The notification appears in the {In Progress} workqueue for follow-up and completion.

A vital event notification involves the capture of a minimal set of data related to the occurrence of a vital event and transmission of this to the civil registration authority. In OpenCRVS a notification can be sent by a Field Agent by submitting a partially complete declaration, or it can be submitted from a digital health system e.g. DHIS2, both of which can then found in the {In Progress} workqueue for follow-up and action.
