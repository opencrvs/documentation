  Perform an advanced search of civil registration records from a trusted,
  external e-Gov service

# Record Search clients

The Record Search client can perform an advanced search of civil registration records. Use this to help support social protection systems, check the existence of civil registration records or check citizen demographics.

To stop abuse of such a powerful API, all results returned are audited as having been downloaded by the client. System Administrators should be careful to ensure that citizen data is not exposed to untrustworthy individuals by using this API.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All client behaviour is audited and is ultimately the personal responsibility of the National System Administrator of OpenCRVS that created the client. Protect citizen data and do not expose it unnecessarily as you may be in breach of local laws.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A daily limit of 2000 Record Search requests per client, per day is hardcoded into OpenCRVS Core. Any subsequent requests will fail.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use our [Postman collections](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/tree/master/postman) to test Record Search API functionality. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a tool you can download to test API access before building your integrations.

**Submitting a Record Search**

To submit an Record Search, your client must first request an [authorization token ](authenticate-a-client.md)using your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

#### Record Search Requests

With the token as an authorization header, the following example request will submit a record search in GraphQL. GraphQL is the chosen protocol as this API re-uses the same **Advanced Search** GraphQL queries that are used buy the OpenCRVS GUI.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can browse to the [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground/) using an authorization header to view the full documentation for the searchEvents GraphQL query.

**GraphQL variables.advancedSearchParameters object**

We recommend that you use the Advanced Search feature in the OpenCRVS application and monitor the GraphQL payload that is sent to the Gateway using the Chrome Developer Tools "Network" tab, in order to understand how these parameters are formatted. The table below lists all possible parameters with a description and example where we feel further explanation is helpful.

**Record Search Response**

The response from a record search is not FHIR, but an Elasticsearch response. The audit experience is explained below the example payload.
