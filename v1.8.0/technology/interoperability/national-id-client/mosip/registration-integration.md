  Using MOSIP's Packet Manager API for asynchronous integration at the point of
  registration

# Registration integration

{% hint style="info" %}
This section assumes that you have already read the general [National ID registration integration page](../registration-integration.md).   If you have not read that page, read it first for a high level introduction to the concepts, and then return here.
{% endhint %}

### Asynchronous integration

MOSIP integration can only work asynchronously, so ensure that you have enabled the external validation workqueue and prepare to configure the endpoints we described in the link above.
