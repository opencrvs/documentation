# Submitting a hotfix

Found a bug from OpenCRVS? Please refer to our documentation first on [Contributing to OpenCRVS.](https://documentation.opencrvs.org/general/contributing#reporting-new-issues)

At any given time, OpenCRVS Core team has two minor versions in ongoing support:
- The latest minor version (e.g. 1.8.x)
- The previous support version (e.g. 1.7.x)

In most cases, all bugs found from OpenCRVS are fixed in both of these versions and only after that merged into the `develop` branch. For this reason it's critical, that a specific process is followed when contributing bug fixes to OpenCRVS.

Thew following diagram describes this process in detail:
