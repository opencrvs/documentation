# 5.3 Managing system users

### Before you start

* Local System Admins and National System Admins can create and edit new users
* You can have as many Field Agents, Registration Agents, Registrars and Performance Managers as you want in an office
* Creating new Registrars requires you to upload a digital signature by default

### Steps

1. **Search for the office**\
   Use the search to find the office you want to add users too.\\
2. **Create a Field Agent**\
   Click the add new user button and complete the form with their details.\
   \
   Select Field Agent from the dropdown.\

   \
   Select the type of role.\

   \
   Review and confirm the new user details.\\
3. **Create a Registration Agent, Performance Managers or Local System Admins**\
   The steps to creating these users is the same as a Field Agent except there is no role type for these users. \\
4. **Create a Registrar**\
   In additional to the details required to create other user types, you are required to upload a signature of the Registrar. This will create a digital signature which will appear on the birth and death certificate. You can use a tool such as the [Online Signature Creator](http://www.onlinesignaturecreator.com/) to create high quality transparent digital signatures, alternatively you can use these steps:\
   \- Ask the Registrar to sign a piece of paper.\
   \- Scan the piece of paper\
   \- Use [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) to convert the bitmap into a smooth scaleable vector.\
   \- Using a design tool such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com), add the signature to an artboard. Keep the artboard aspect ratio consistent so that all digital signatures uploaded to OpenCRVS are the same size. The aspect ratio you choose will depend on your certificate design but we recommend 3:1.\

   For either method, export the signature to PNG format and upload. Then review the new Registrar details and confirm.
