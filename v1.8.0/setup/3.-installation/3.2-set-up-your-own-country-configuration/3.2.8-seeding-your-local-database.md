### Seeding your local databases

{% hint style="info" %}
Now that your source files are prepared, you are ready to "seed" your OpenCRVS database with data.
{% endhint %}

1. Ensure that OpenCRVS is running, including your countryconfig server by following the instructions in: [**3.1.3 Starting and stopping OpenCRVS**](../3.1-set-up-a-development-environment/3.1.3-starting-and-stopping-opencrvs.md)**.**
2. Open a new Terminal window and cd inside opencrvs-core:

```
cd opencrvs-core
```

3. Run the following command

```
yarn seed:dev
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Now that your database has been seeded, you have completed the country configuration and you can log in to OpenCRVS!**  Proceed to the next step to learn more about some of the important API endpoints exposed by the running countryconfig service.
{% endhint %}



### Clearing your local databases

During development, you may wish to clear your local database so that you can seed it again with new files.

1. Ensure that opencrvs-core is running.
2. Open a new terminal window and cd into your opencrvs-core directory
3. Run the following command:

```
yarn db:clear:all
```
