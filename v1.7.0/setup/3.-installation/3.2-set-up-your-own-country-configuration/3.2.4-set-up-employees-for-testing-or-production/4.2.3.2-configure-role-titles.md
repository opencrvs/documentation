# 4.2.3.2 Configure roles and scopes

Following the guidance explained regarding the possible authorization [user scopes ](../../../../product-specifications/users/)that are available, now you can configure the user roles that are applied to each employee.

You make these configurations in TypeScript in the [src/data-seeding/roles/roles.ts](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/3887d6766b6e28faa99ffb19610ab1899d05cac4/src/data-seeding/roles/roles.ts#L10) file.  You can see the examples that we have created for our default configuration - [Farajaland set of users and scopes](../../../../default-configuration/opencrvs-configuration-in-farajaland/user-role-mapping.md) in this file.

Here is a section of code that you can see in the roles array:

```
import { SCOPES, Scope } from '@opencrvs/toolkit/scopes'
import { MessageDescriptor } from 'react-intl'

type Role = {
  id: string
  label: MessageDescriptor
  scopes: Scope[]
}

export const roles: Role[] = [
  {
    id: 'FIELD_AGENT',
    label: {
      defaultMessage: 'Field Agent',
      description: 'Name for user role Field Agent',
      id: 'userRole.fieldAgent'
    },
    scopes: [
      SCOPES.RECORD_DECLARE_BIRTH,
      SCOPES.RECORD_DECLARE_DEATH,
      SCOPES.RECORD_DECLARE_MARRIAGE,
      SCOPES.RECORD_SUBMIT_INCOMPLETE,
      SCOPES.RECORD_SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW,
      SCOPES.SEARCH_BIRTH,
      SCOPES.SEARCH_DEATH,
      SCOPES.SEARCH_MARRIAGE
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'POLICE_OFFICER',
    label: {
      defaultMessage: 'Police Officer',
      description: 'Name for user role Police Officer',
      id: 'userRole.policeOfficer'
    },
    scopes: [
      SCOPES.RECORD_DECLARE_BIRTH,
      SCOPES.RECORD_DECLARE_DEATH,
      SCOPES.RECORD_DECLARE_MARRIAGE,
      SCOPES.RECORD_SUBMIT_INCOMPLETE,
      SCOPES.RECORD_SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW,
      SCOPES.SEARCH_BIRTH,
      SCOPES.SEARCH_DEATH,
      SCOPES.SEARCH_MARRIAGE
    ]
  }, ...
```

* The **id** property must be unique and map to the role constant used in your employees' csv files explained in the previous section.
* The **label** property must be a [react-intl formatjs ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl)object with a translation for the visible label that you wish to apply to this user role.  Appropriate translations must exist in your client.csv file for the **label.id** where necessary.  You can learn about how to configure OpenCRVS content translation in the section: [Managing Language Content](../3.2.5-set-up-application-settings/3.2.9.1-managing-language-content/).
* The **scopes** array is where you configure the constants for the available [scopes](../../../../product-specifications/users/).  The supported scopes are imported from the [@opencrvs/toolkit ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opencrvs/toolkit)TypeScript library.
