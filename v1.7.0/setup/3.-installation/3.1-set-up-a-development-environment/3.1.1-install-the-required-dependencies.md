# 4.1.1 Install the required dependencies

### Install dependencies locally

OpenSource software is required to be installed on your local machine in order to run OpenCRVS.  Ensure you have satisfied all of the following requirements before continuing:

* [ ] **Operation system**: Linux or Unix operating system is required: OpenCRVS has been tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Mac OSX : If you do not have Ubuntu or MacOSX, use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or install a [virtual](https://www.virtualbox.org/) [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) environment on your computer and use that environment to continue.
* [ ] **Admin rights**: You must have admin rights over your computer and a sudo password
* [ ] **Git**: You must have a [Git](https://github.com/) account and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) software
* [ ] **Disk space and RAM:** A minimum of 50GB of hard drive space must be available and at least 16GB of RAM.  At least 4CPU Cores and 16GB RAM ensure the best experience avoiding any start up errors with ElasticSearch.  If you are using virtualisation, ensure this is dedicated to the environment.
* [ ] **Docker**: Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [ ] **NodeJS:** Install Node using the [Node Version Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm). This tutorial: [https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-use-node-version-manager-nvm/](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-use-node-version-manager-nvm/) is quite good compared to the official documentation which is a little hard to follow.  Node version: 18.19.0 is required. &#x20;
* [ ] **Yarn:** Install the [Yarn Package Manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for Node
* [ ] **Chrome:** Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome). OpenCRVS is a [progressive web application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive\_web\_apps/Introduction) and PWA's work best in Chrome.
* [ ] **tmux:** Install [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). Multiple terminal windows are required to run OpenCRVS Core alongside the default country configuration. On Ubuntu run: `sudo apt-get install tmux` to install. On Mac, you can install tmux using Homebrew or MacPorts.
