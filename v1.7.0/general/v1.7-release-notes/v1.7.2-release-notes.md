# v1.7.2: Release notes

## OpenCRVS core v1.7.2

#### New features

* **TimeField component with AM/PM support**: The `TimeField` component now supports both 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats through a new prop, `use12HourFormat: boolean`. The logic has been refactored into two separate components, `TimeInput24` and `TimeInput12`. The `TimeField` component automatically selects the appropriate component based on the prop. [#8336](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8336)
* **Configurable Scopes**: Introduce a new syntax for scopes which provides more customizability to the SI's via scopes. Two new scopes `user.create[role=a|b|c]` & `user.update[role=d|e|f]` are getting included in this release which can be used to restrict what the role of a newly created or updated user can be set to by the user of a particular role. Gradually most of the existing scopes will be migrated to use this new syntax.
* **New Full Honorific Name Field**: An optional `fullHonorificName` field has been added to the user management page to capture the complete name of a user including their title or honorific. This field can be used for display purposes, including rendering the name appropriately on certificates.

#### Bug fixes

* Filter out inactive locations in the Organisations menu [#8782](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8782)
* Improve quick search results when searching by name [#9272](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9272)
* Fix practitioner role history entries from being created with every view and download [#9462](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9462)
* Fix a child's NID form field cannot be added eithe rmanually or via ESignet. A father section cannot be placed before a mother section if you wish to use a radio button to control mapping addresses from one individual to aother to make data entry easier [#9582](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9582)
* Fix the role of the certifier unable to get resolved for new users which in turn caused the download of the declaration to fail [#9643](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9643)
* Fix one failing unassign blocking all other unassign actions from continuing [#9651](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9651)
* Fix record not getting unassigned when validating an already validated record again [#9648](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9648)

## OpenCRVS Country config template v1.7.2

#### Bugfixes

* A configuration example of how to use middle names in a supported way has been added, inspired by \[#9369((https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/9369))
* InfluxDB `max-values-per-tag` is now set to unlimited to temporarily fix the following error when clearing data from a deployed environment [#393](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/393)

```
partial write: max-values-per-tag limit exceeded (100000/100000)
```

* Added `user.update:my-jurisdiction` scope to Local System Admin to allow editing of users in jurisdiction [#732](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/732)

#### New features

*   **Time field 12-hour format**: To enable the 12-hour (AM/PM) format of the `TimeField`, set the `use12HourFormat` property to `true`. [#8336](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8336)

    ```
    {
      name: 'time',
      custom: true,
      type: 'TIME',
      use12HourFormat: true,
      ...otherProp
    }
    ```
* **Control over allowed user creation/update**: user.create\[role=role\_a|role\_b] & user.update\[role=role\_a|role\_b] can be used to control users of which role can be created/updated by users of a certain role.

#### Breaking changes

* Roles with the following scopes: `USER_CREATE, USER_CREATE_MY_JURISDICTION` & `USER_UPDATE, USER_UPDATE_MY_JURISDICTION` need to have the `user.create[role=role_a|role_b]` & `user.update[role=role_a|role_b]` scopes added to them (replace role\_a|role\_b with the role IDs of your selection) in order to work as expected. If you are using custom roles, please make sure to update them accordingly.
