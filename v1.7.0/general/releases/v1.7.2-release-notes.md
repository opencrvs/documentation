# v1.7.12: Release notes

**New features**

- **TimeField component with AM/PM support**: The `TimeField` component now supports both 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats through a new prop, `use12HourFormat: boolean`. The logic has been refactored into two separate components, `TimeInput24` and `TimeInput12`. The `TimeField` component automatically selects the appropriate component based on the prop. [#8336](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/8336)
- **Configurable Scopes**: Introduce a new syntax for scopes which provides more customizability to the SI's via scopes. Two new scopes `user.create[role=a|b|c]` & `user.update[role=d|e|f]` are getting included in this release which can be used to restrict what the role of a newly created or updated user can be set to by the user of a particular role. Gradually most of the existing scopes will be migrated to use this new syntax.
- **New Full Honorific Name Field**: An optional `fullHonorificName` field has been added to the user management page to capture the complete name of a user including their title or honorific. This field can be used for display purposes, including rendering the name appropriately on certificates.
