# Product roadmap

## The OpenCRVS Use Case Inventory

We often get the question "What does OpenCRVS do?". Beyond the descriptions found in the [functional-architecture.md](../product-specifications/functional-architecture.md "mention") section, we maintain a full inventory of use cases, which will allow you to quickly map existing and future use cases supported by OpenCRVS with your own country requirements.&#x20;

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/OpenCRVS Use Cases Inventory v1.7.0.xlsx" %}

In addition to the functional and integration use cases, as separate tab includes non-functional requirements (NFRs) that we believe are important for national scale civil registration systems, the majority of which OpenCRVS is already compliant. &#x20;

## Future release dates

The following table provides an overview of projected delivery dates for future releases, as defined in the Use Case Inventory above.&#x20;

* The beta release is typically made available after initial QA testing, but before full regression testing has been commenced. It is not intended for live use in a production environment, however it allows accredited implementation partners to test out sample configurations and to contribute to the release testing effort.
* All dates provided are indicative and are subject to change, however OpenCRVS Product Management makes every effort to provide accurate estimates to support implementation planning.&#x20;

| Release | Beta release date | Full release date |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| v1.8.0  |                   |                   |
| v1.9.0  |                   |                   |
| v1.10.0 |                   |                   |

## Future product scope

The scope for future releases of OpenCRVS is primarily determined based on confirmed system requirements coming from current and future OpenCRVS implementations.&#x20;
