### Ongoing-Costs

As you have probably gathered from the server configuration section, some additional tooling is required to be paid for. These costs are negligble and support your installation with a secure code repository, bug tracking systems, alerting and forensic analysis. &#x20;

The Ongoing-Costs Excel sheet outlines the ownerhsip, status and costs and helps you project manage the provisioning of these tools.  They are explained in this video.

### Data Security Framework

The purpose of this document is to provide organisations with:

* An understanding of data security and privacy risks.&#x20;
* An understanding of the technical steps taken in OpenCRVS to mitigate against these risks.
* A guidance framework for the development of context-specific data security policies and procedures that should be designed and introduced by a government that has chosen to install OpenCRVS and digitise their civil registration system. &#x20;
* Security guidance for project managers and all staff involved on a temporary or continual basis in the following stages of an OpenCRVS project: a) design & implementation b) monitoring & maintenance and c) day-to-day usage of OpenCRVS.

Make sure that this document is shared with key stakeholders.
