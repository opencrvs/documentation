**Requirements templates**

Download our Excel templates to help you gather and define requirements for your OpenCRVS implementation [OpenCRVS Requirements Templates](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/wiki/Gather-requirements)
{% endhint %}

### Checklist

* [ ] **Gather and analysis the rules and regulations for civil registration in your country**\
  These will be used to inform configuration parameters such as the legally stipulated timeframe to register a vital event, questions you must ask in the forms (supporting document requirements etc.) \
  \
  Note**.** Rules and regulations should help a country achieve universal civil registration, not get in the way. A comprehensive review of all CRVS rules and regulations should be conducted as part of analysis to inform effective digitised civil registration services - this may mean reform is required as part of a digital transformation programme.\

* [ ] **Create as-is and to-be business process maps**\
  Understanding the current challenges and how future processes (enabled by technology) can overcome these, is critical to a successful transformation of your civil registration services. These processes will inform which users do what in your country.  Using the CRVS Digitisation Guidebook ([http://www.crvs-dgb.org/en/](http://www.crvs-dgb.org/en/)) can help you conduct business process analysis as well as a number of other activities that effectively prepare for CRVS digitisation. [3.1-mapping-business-processes.md](3.1-mapping-business-processes.md "mention")\

* [ ] **Use a PoC to identify additional system requirements**\
  OpenCRVS can quickly be configured to understand its applicability for the country context and to identify gaps in the existing product. The PoC is a brilliant opportunity to identify additional system requirements - watch this video to understand how.

* [ ] **Complete the Administrative structure reference template**\
  This will be used ensure that the correct administrative structure is in place to enable registration workflows and effective reporting. \

*   [ ] **Complete the Statistical reference data template**

    Population statistics and crude birth and death rates are required to be able to calculate completeness rates using accurate estimates of the number of vital events occurring. For increased accuracy these are required over time and by location. \

* [ ] **Complete the Registration office reference data template**\
  This will be used to populate the product with reference data for these offices\

* [ ] **Complete and Health facilities reference data template**\
  This will be used to populate the declaration form so a health facility can be selected as a place of birth or death\

* [ ] **Complete the Application Settings template**\
  You can make the product look and feel like yours by uploading a logo to appear throughout the product [3.3-define-your-application-settings.md](3.3-define-your-application-settings.md "mention")\

* [ ] **Complete the User Mapping template**\
  Map Registration roles in your country to system roles in OpenCRVS\

* [ ] **Design your event declaration forms**\
  Get hold of the existing registration forms and consider how you could optimise them for the digital world [3.4-designing-event-declaration-forms.md](3.4-designing-event-declaration-forms.md "mention")\

* [ ] **Design vital event certificates**\
  When using a digital system, you can re-design vital event certificates to look good and be fit for purpose including innovations such as QR codes. Don't just digitise a paper certificate that wasn't designed with digital in mind. [3.5-designing-a-certificate-template.md](3.5-designing-a-certificate-template.md "mention")\

* [ ] **Add translations**\
  If you will offer the product in multiple languages, you need to translate the English copy into these languages in advance of configuration\
