# Users

The different user roles in the system, and defined below, reflect common actors involved in civil registration services around the world as well as non-traditional actors that may help improve service delivery e.g. field agents who can take services to the community.

**System Roles and User types**\
\
OpenCRVS has set roles with defined responsibilities in the system. You can create different user types based on your requirements and map them to these system roles. \
\
For example in Farajaland there are two different Field Agents: Hostpital Clerk and Community Leader. They are different user roles but all have the same responsibilities in the system.
{% endhint %}
