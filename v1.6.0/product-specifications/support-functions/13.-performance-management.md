# 16. Performance management

OpenCRVS dashboards leverage the power of Metabase to transform civil registration data into insightful visualisations. Each dashboard is highly customisable, allowing users to create and integrate various data views to suit their specific needs. Out of the box, OpenCRVS is equipped with an array of default visualisations to give insight on the standard civil registration and vital statistics KPIs.

Helping performance managers understand how their system and workflows are performing and inform targeted corrective action. To ensure they are on target to achieving universal registration rates.

OpenCRVS provides 4 performance views:

1. **Registrations**: Infographics of registration data (Access: Performance Manager)
