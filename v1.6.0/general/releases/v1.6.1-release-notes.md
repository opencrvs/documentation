# v1.6.1: Release notes

### Bug fixes

- Maximum upload file size limit is now based on the size of the uploaded files after compression and not before. [#7840](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7840)
- Stops local sys admins creating national level users. [#7698](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7698)

### New features

- Add an optional configurable field in section `canContinue` which takes an expression. Falsy value of this expression will disable the continue button in forms. This can be used to work with fetch field which has a loading state and prevent the user to get past the section while the request is still in progress.
