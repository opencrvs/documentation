  In OpenCRVS v1.6.0, alongside numerous technical improvements and bug fixes, we have enhanced form configuration flexibility. Signatures inputs are now part of the form configuration, giving you greated control over where and when they are shown. You can now also add conditions to filter options in document select inputs.

# v1.6.0: Release notes

## Breaking Changes

- **Informant notification configuration moved to countryconfig**
  The informant notification settings are no longer configurable via the UI. These settings must now be defined in the `record-notification` endpoint in countryconfig.

- **Config changes to review/preview and signatures**
  Default review/preview sections and signature field definitions (e.g., informant or bride signatures) are no longer hardcoded. These must be added through countryconfig. For reference, a new default preview section can be defined as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "preview",
    "viewType": "preview",
    "name": {
      "defaultMessage": "Preview",
      "id": "register.form.section.preview.name"
    },
    "groups": [
      {
        "id": "preview-view-group",
        "fields": []
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- GraphQL API: **Updated Gateways searchEvents API**
  The `operationHistories` API now only returns `operationType` and `operatedOn`, removing unused fields.

- GraphQL API: **Replaced `hasChildLocation` with `isLeafLevelLocation` query**
  This new query is more descriptive and better aligns with its intended use.

## New Features

- **Conditional filtering for document select options**
  Options in the `DOCUMENT_UPLOADER_WITH_OPTION` field can now be conditionally filtered using the `optionCondition` property.

- **Certificate handlebars**

  - Added `registrationFees` to display registration fees. [#6817](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6817)
  - Added `loggedInUser` to display details of the logged-in user. [#6529](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6529)
  - Introduced a "preview" handlebar to conditionally render SVG elements, such as background images, during certificate previews.

- **Default search criteria configuration**
  Administrators can now set default search criteria for record searches, streamlining workflows. [#6924](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6924)

- **HTTP request form components**
  Added support for new form components (`HTTP`, `BUTTON`, `REDIRECT`) to enable HTTP request creation within forms. [#7489](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7489)

- **Required supporting document fields**
  Supporting document fields can now be configured as mandatory.

- **Single document uploader option**
  If only one document type is available in the uploader, the select dropdown remains hidden, and the upload button defaults to the only available option.

- **Client-server version validation**
  Added checks to ensure the client and server are on the same version, preventing outdated clients from sending invalid requests. [#6695](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6695)

## Improvements

- **Flexible `family` name field**
  The `family` name field, previously required, is now optional, allowing more flexibility in form configurations.

- **PDF generation respects SVG dimensions**
  PDF page sizes now adapt to specified SVG dimensions instead of defaulting to A4.

- **HTML support in certificate PDFs**
  Added support for `foreignObject` HTML content in SVG templates for certificate PDFs.

- **Removed leftover application config features**
  Features such as certificates and informant notifications have been removed from the application config UI. [#7156](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7156)
