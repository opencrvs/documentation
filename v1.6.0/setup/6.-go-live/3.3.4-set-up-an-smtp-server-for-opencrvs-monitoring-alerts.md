# 7.1 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

We provide you with the pre-deployment checklist Excel file that you must complete before going live in your country.  Some points are explained in this video and table:

As they are a super user, they must confirm that the new password is saved in a password manager tool.                                            |
| Github account is owned by country and OpenCRVS Core team are removed as admins                                                                      | If the OpenCRVS team have assisted you to set up your Github organisation, they must no longer have "Admin" rights in your countryconfig repository otherwise they can potentially access citizen data.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Disable password SSH access, and enable 2FA SSH access. Verify users are required to set up 2FA and that the code is asked on every login after that | Our Provision Action should have enforced this but it is always a good idea to make sure that this is working successfully and no bugs have been introduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Ongoing-Costs

As you have probably gathered from the server configuration section, some additional tooling is required to be paid for. These costs are negligble and support your installation with a secure code repository, bug tracking systems, alerting and forensic analysis. &#x20;

The Ongoing-Costs Excel sheet outlines the ownerhsip, status and costs and helps you project manage the provisioning of these tools.  They are explained in this video.

### Data Security Framework

The purpose of this document is to provide organisations with:

* An understanding of data security and privacy risks.&#x20;
* An understanding of the technical steps taken in OpenCRVS to mitigate against these risks.
* A guidance framework for the development of context-specific data security policies and procedures that should be designed and introduced by a government that has chosen to install OpenCRVS and digitise their civil registration system. &#x20;
* Security guidance for project managers and all staff involved on a temporary or continual basis in the following stages of an OpenCRVS project: a) design & implementation b) monitoring & maintenance and c) day-to-day usage of OpenCRVS.

Make sure that this document is shared with key stakeholders.
