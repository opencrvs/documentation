# 3. Installation

This section introduces the installation steps that your Technical System Administrator will be required to run in order to:

1. Set-up a **local, demo development environment of OpenCRVS** using our fictional country configuration: "Farajaland".
2. Fork our Farajaland country configuration repository and configure it with the technical reference data required in order to run OpenCRVS for your country.
3. Provision server hosting to deploy your OpenCRVS country configuration to a secure and publicly accessible server on the Internet.

All the steps in this section must be completed before OpenCRVS can be configured.

Once this section is completed a less technical system administrator can login as a National System Administrator user to perform application, form and certificate configuration steps, documented in the Configuration section.&#x20;
